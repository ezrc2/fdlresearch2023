Academics,"COURSE LOADS AND OVERLOADS
The normal course load varies depending on the student's situation. For example, for a student who is devoting full time to an academic program (i.e., who is not employed as a teaching assistant or otherwise), the normal course load might be 16 hours in a semester and 8 hours in a summer session. Students who are employed (as assistants or in outside work), of course, will have smaller normal loads. For a person holding a half-time assistantship, for example, a normal load would be 8-12 hours per semester and 4-8 hours in the summer."
Academics,The maximum number of hours a student can take in a given term depends on the level of the student's University appointment (if any) according to the table below. These maxima cannot be exceeded except under unusual circumstances; a petition to the Graduate College is required at the time of registration for approval of an overload.
Academics,"Persons holding a Graduate College or University Fellowship must enroll for a minimum of 12 hours during a semester, and must enroll for at least 4 hours during Summer 2 term. Specific information about the Graduate College definitions of course loads may by found in the Graduate College Handbook
here
."
Academics,"EXCUSED GRADES: INCOMPLETE AND F-BY-RULE
It is possible for graduate students to receive I (Incomplete) grades in courses in which they are enrolled, but whether an I grade is received in a given case is a matter between the student and the instructor. Some faculty, for example, have a policy of not giving I grades, and hence students should not presume the availability of such grades. When an I grade has been received, a grade must be reported by the instructor not later than reading day at the end of the next regular semester. If a grade is not reported by the deadline, the I grade automatically converts to a grade of F-by-rule (as distinguished from an ""earned"" grade of F). For details on the general policy of the Graduate College with respect to this matter, see The Graduate College Handbook; for the specific deadlines in a given semester. See the university calendar (follow the calendar links from the Graduate College
here
)."
Academics,"Save in exceptional circumstances, the department
will not
approve requests seeking: (a) the extension of the deadline for reporting a grade to replace an I grade, (b) the replacement of an F-by-rule grade with some other grade, or (c) the retroactive withdrawal from a course in which an I or F-by-rule grade is in place. The import of this departmental policy is that students receiving I grades should take care to ensure that the necessary work is completed in a timely fashion so that a grade can be reported before the deadline. The deadline cannot be extended, and if the deadline is not met, then the resulting F-by-rule grade is in place forever and ever."
Academics,"Note: in a few non-thesis courses (such as CMN 595, the independent study course), it is possible to receive either a DFR (Deferred) grade or an I (Incomplete) grade. But in such courses, the two grades function identically--same time limits for grade reporting, same automatic conversion to F-by-rule, etc. Thus, everything said above about I grades (including the department's policy on deadline extensions, etc.) also applies to DFR grades received in non-thesis courses. (DFR grades received in the thesis course, CMN 599, are another kettle of fish altogether; those DFR grades never convert to F-by-rule grades, but instead remain as DFR grades until the thesis/dissertation defense is held.)"
Academics,"CMN 595 and 599
CMN 595 is used for two purposes: Independent studies and Preliminary Exams. Independent Studies involve work on a topic or project that is not related to a thesis or dissertation. Students register for these using the CRN of the faculty member who is directing the independent work."
Academics,"Preliminary exams are graded using the 595 option. Prior to the semester when Ph.D. students plan to defend their preliminary examinations, they generally should register for 8 hours of CMN 595 using their advisor's CRN. They should also register for 4 hours of 599 to get their total number of hours to 12."
Academics,"Whether it is for an independent study or preliminary exams, if you take a DFR or I in CMN 595, you must complete the work and your instructor must submit a grade change before reading day of the following semester, or your grade will automatically convert to a grade of F-by-rule."
Academics,"CMN 599 is used for dissertation research. Most Ph.D. students done with course work should enroll in 12 hours of CMN 599. If you are taking one other course, you can enroll for 8 hours. The key is to get the total to 12 hours. If you are in residence and still on assistantship, you must register every semester for CMN 599 while working toward your degree. Generally speaking, if you are done with classes you should always enroll for 12 hours of CMN 599; the one exception is during the semester in which you defend your preliminary exams. Then, you'll enroll for 8 hours of 595 plus 4 hours of CMN 599 as explained above."
Academics,"ANNUAL REVIEWS
The Graduate College requires programs to conduct annual reviews of all graduate students in the program. The annual review is an important component of your graduate education, because it allows you, your advisor, and other faculty to share information and allows you to receive useful, timely feedback about your academic development and performance. In late March of each year, you will be asked to send a CV to your advisor and to fill out a PDF form outlining your activities over the past year. After the faculty meets for the annual review, your advisor will fill out and sign the advisor portion of the form and provide you with a copy for feedback. Your advisor may also schedule a one-on-one meeting to talk with you about the results of the review. A copy of each year’s form will also be placed in your department file.

Campus,"By 1967, the
University of Illinois system
consisted of a main campus in Champaign-Urbana and two Chicago campuses, Chicago Circle (UICC) and Medical Center (UIMC), and people began using ""Urbana-Champaign"" or the reverse to refer to the main campus specifically. The university name officially changed to the ""
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
"" by 1977. While this was a reversal of the commonly used designation for the metropolitan area (
Champaign-Urbana
), most of the campus is located in Urbana. The name change established a separate identity for the main campus within the University of Illinois system, which today includes campuses in Springfield (
UIS
) and Chicago (
UIC
) (formed by the merger of UICC and UIMC)."
Campus,"The main research and academic facilities are divided almost evenly between the twin cities of
Urbana
and
Champaign
, which form part of the
Champaign–Urbana metropolitan area
. Four main quads compose the center of the university and are arranged from north to south. The Beckman Quadrangle and the
John Bardeen
Quadrangle occupy the center of the
Engineering Campus
.
Boneyard Creek
flows through the John Bardeen Quadrangle, parallel to Green Street. The Beckman Quadrangle, named after
Arnold Orville Beckman
, is primarily composed of research units and laboratories, and features a large solar calendar consisting of an obelisk and several copper fountains. The Main Quadrangle and South Quadrangle follow immediately after the John Bardeen Quad. The former makes up a large part of the
Liberal Arts and Sciences
portion of the campus, while the latter comprises many of the buildings of the
College of Agriculture, Consumer, and Environmental Sciences
(ACES) spread across the campus map.
[45]"
Campus,"Additionally, the research fields of the College of ACES stretch south from Urbana and Champaign into
Savoy
and
Champaign County
. The university also maintains formal gardens and a conference center in nearby
Monticello
at
Allerton Park
."
Campus,"The campus is known for its landscape and architecture, as well as distinctive landmarks.
It was identified as one of 50 college or university ""works of art"" by T.A. Gaines in his book [46]"
Campus,"The university has several museums, galleries, and archives which include

Dedicated on October 4, 2001, it is a $21 million state-of-the-art facility containing 52,000 net assignable square feet. It integrates traditional information sources with new learning and information technologies. In addition to shelving, seating, reading, circulation, and office space, the library provides enhanced technology areas, an information instruction laboratory, electronic information workstations, and an online search room. The facility also houses four instructional and multimedia laboratories and studios, as well as an Information and Career Services Office and an Alumni Center."
Campus,"Allerton was deeded to the University of Illinois by Robert Allerton in 1946. Originally called “the farms,” the former private estate includes formal gardens, an extensive landscape park dotted with ornaments and fine art, and a manor house modeled after Ham House in England. Allerton House was built in 1900 and now serves as a conference center. In 1971 the lowland and southern forests of 1,000 acres were declared a National Natural Landmark and in 2007 one of the Seven Wonders of Illinois."
Campus,"Designed by Nathan C. Ricker and James M. White, Altgeld Hall was completed in 1897, with additions in 1914, 1919, 1926, and 1956. When first occupied, it had a museum in the basement, the University Library on the first floor, and stacks and offices on the second floor; it then served as the law building, 1927 to 1955, and the math building and library, 1955 to the present. Named after Illinois Governor John P. Altgeld, the building is considered one of the finest examples of Richardsonian Romanesque architecture in Illinois. The central room is decorated with murals by Newton A. Wells."
Campus,"Now positioned at the west gateway to the University on Green and Wright Streets, stood until 1962 behind Foellinger Auditorium on the south campus—where romantically inclined students were wont to keep the throne “shiny and well used.” Designed by University graduate Lorado Taft, the statue was unveiled on June 12, 1929. The Alma Mater is shown “as a benign and majestic woman in scholastic robes, who rises from her throne and advances a step with outstretched arms, a gesture of generously greeting her children” (Taft). Learning and Labor flank the main figure. An inscription reads: To thy happy children of the future those of the past send greetings."
Campus,"The Armory was designed as a military drill hall, an athletic facility, and an assembly hall. More than 2,000 soldiers used the Armory as a dormitory during World War I. Constructed in 1912-14 and modified in 1925-27 and 1962, the building is something of an engineering feat: the long span structure was unique in its day. An example of Georgian Revival architecture, the Armory is an anchor point for the south campus."
Campus,"The Astronomical Observatory was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1990, primarily for the advances in astronomy associated with the structure. Under the direction of Professor Joel Stebbins from 1907 to 1922, the observatory was the site for developing the selenium cell and the photoelectric cell, which revolutionized the science of photoelectric photometry—the technique used to measure celestial magnitudes. Revolving around a circular track, the dome rides on 10 wheels and was originally cranked by hand. Much of the original equipment is intact, and the 12-inch refracting telescope is still used for classes. The building was constructed in 1896 at a cost of $15,000; the architect was Charles A. Gunn."
Campus,"Beckman is the largest research building on campus and anchors the far end of the north campus. It is constructed on the site of the University’s first building, which was demolished in 1881 (also site of the Illinois Field baseball diamond and the University’s first collegiate homecoming in 1910). Designed by Smith, Hinchman & Grylls and completed in 1989, the institute was made possible by a $40 million gift from alumnus Arnold O. Beckman and his wife, Mabel M. Beckman. Their gift was supplemented by $10 million from the State of Illinois."
Campus,"The IGB is a $75 million, 186,000 square-foot state-of-the-art facility dedicated to transformative research in agriculture, human health, the environment, and energy use and production. The institute, established in 2007, was founded on the vision of converging the university’s resources and expertise to address grand challenges facing society. The building design facilitates collaboration between the faculty and students who use the open labs and communal meeting spaces to conduct multi-disciplinary research. In addition the building was constructed in such a way that it will never cast shade over the crops grown in the neighboring Morrow Plots."
Campus,"With its dome, Foellinger recalls Thomas Jefferson’s Rotunda on the University of Virginia campus. The auditorium has a copper roof and cornice. Considered an example of the Beaux Arts Classical style, it was built in 1907 from a design by Clarence Blackall. In 1984, the auditorium was completely renovated with funds provided by alumna Helene Foellinger."
Campus,"Named in honor of William Wallace Grainger, this library information center opened in 1994. The history of the site of the Grainger Engineering Library Information Center is intertwined with the history of North Campus, the cradle of the University of Illinois itself. The facility sits on the spot where one of the first buildings on campus, Mechanical Building and Drill Hall, was erected in 1871. The building has 92,000 square feet of assignable space and includes two-story reading rooms, seminar rooms, group and scholar studies, and conference rooms, and houses over 300,000 volumes of engineering materials."
Campus,"The trolley stand at the north end of the Quad on South Mathews Avenue was originally located on Green Street. It was situated halfway between Champaign and Urbana and served “University stop” on the horse-drawn street-car that ran east-west. First erected in 1885, the structure was moved from storage to its present site in 1964."
Campus,"The east entry to the campus at Lincoln Avenue and Illinois Street features the stone portal from the entrance to the first University-built classroom building, University Hall. The portal entrance apparently was kept behind the Architecture Building for a number of years and then seemingly disappeared from the campus until it was found at Robert Allerton Park in Monticello in 1994. Alan and Phyllis Welsh Hallene, U of I supporters and alumni, donated the funds to construct the gateway plaza, which was dedicated in 1998."
Campus,"Originally the Chemical Laboratory, Harker Hall was until recently the oldest remaining classroom building on the campus. Designed by Nathan C. Ricker (with John M. Van Odsel) and built in 1878, Harker Hall is considered Second Empire in style. It is named for Judge Oliver A. Harker, third dean of the law school (1903 to 1916) and the first University counsel. In 1896 the building was struck by lightning and partly burned. The University of Illinois Foundation moved to Harker Hall after extensive renovations in 1992."
Campus,"The Union was financed with a $450,000 grant from the Public Works Administration and a $550,000 loan from the University of Illinois Foundation. Its Georgian Revival style was conceived by Ernest L. Stouffer, University architect, and Howard Cheney, consulting architect. The cupola, clock, and bell from University Hall (demolished) are retained in the Union. Much of the original woodwork was carved by John C. Freiburg. The building was constructed in 1939-40; a $6.9 million addition in 1960 dramatically increased its size and usefulness. The Union is considered one of the most significant buildings on campus, because of its location, character, quality, and use."
Campus,"One of the preeminent performance facilities in the nation, Krannert is largely the result of an additional contribution from the Krannerts. Completed in 1969, the center covers seven acres and includes four theaters and an outdoor amphitheater. The complex was designed by alumnus and architect Max Abramovitz, who served on the design team for the Lincoln Center in New York City. It is home to more than 350 performances each year."
Campus,"The stadium was dedicated on October 18, 1924, with a football game against the University of Michigan that has become legendary. The University’s Harold “Red” Grange scored four touchdowns against Michigan in the first twelve minutes, then ran for a fifth touchdown and threw for a sixth. A mixture of Georgian Revival and Neoclassical architecture, the structure is considered one of the nation’s most distinctive sports stadiums. The second story is a colonnade of paired limestone Roman Doric columns, representing University of Illinois students who perished in World War I. More than 20,000 students, alumni, and friends of the University contributed approximately $1.7 million to fund the construction."
Campus,"Between the underground Undergraduate Library and the Institute for Genomic Biology, the Morrow Plots are the country’s oldest experimental agricultural fields in continuous use. Agriculture professor Manley Miles and first agriculture dean George Morrow began laying out the plots in 1876. Miles first divided the fields into ten plots of 1/2 acre each. Morrow later divided the area further into plots of 1/20 acre. Morrow modeled the plots after agriculture techniques he had observed in Great Britain (Rothamsted in particular) and France. The plots were designated a National Historic Landmark in 1968."
Campus,"Designed by Nathan C. Ricker, the Natural History Building is an example of the High Victorian Gothic style. The original building was completed in 1892, and the departments of botany, zoology, and geology moved in that fall. A lecture hall and museum were added in 1909 and 1910 (W. C. Zimmerman, architect), with another addition in 1923 (J. M. White, architect). The building will undergo a $70 million renovation beginning in 2012."
Campus,"These round barns are the inspiration of Wilbur J. Fraser, the first head of the Department of Dairy Husbandry (1902 to 1913). Fraser was a strong advocate of round barns, which offered the dairy farmer “economy of consideration, low maintenance, and labor efficiency.” He also cited the barns’ better ability to withstand prairie windstorms. Fraser and the University’s demonstration barns were apparently instrumental in popularizing the round barn type found throughout Illinois. The first barn was built in 1907-08; the second and third about 1910."
Campus,"An example of the Beaux Arts Classical style by campus architect James M. White, Smith Hall is considered one of the most handsomely detailed classical buildings on campus. Captain Thomas J. Smith, a member of the Board of Trustees from 1897 to 1903, gave farmland and money totaling approximately $480,500 to finance the construction. The building is named in memory of his wife, Tina Weedon Smith. Details throughout the building, including the ornate Memorial Room on the second floor, feature intricate friezes and door surrounds."
Campus,"From a purely structural standpoint, State Farm Center is the University’s most significant and revolutionary building. Designed by alumnus Max Abramovitz, the reinforced concrete structure cost $8.5 million and is one of the world’s largest edge-supported domes, spanning 400 feet in diameter and rising 128 feet above the floor. The building is the site of commencement ceremonies and basketball games and hosts many performances, plays, and concerts. It opened as the Assembly Hall on Honors Day, May 3, 1963."
Campus,"Funded by a gift from William and Clarice Spurlock, the museum opened on September 26, 2002. The new museum is a state-of-the-art facility which houses approximately 45,000 artifacts from diverse cultures and varied historical time periods, augmented by noteworthy selections from the University’s Museum of Natural History and Department of Anthropology. Facilities include five permanent galleries and a temporary gallery, the 220-seat Knight Auditorium, the Rowe Multipurpose Learning Center, and the World Heritage Museum Guild Educational Resource Center."
Campus,"The home of the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois is the Thomas M. Siebel Center for Computer Science, a state-of-the-art building that opened its doors in 2004. On the north side of campus, home to The Grainger College of Engineering, Siebel Center is an interactive computing habitat, made possible by a gift from alumnus Tom Siebel."
Campus,"This intellectual heart of the campus, is part of the ensemble of fine Georgian Revival buildings designed by Charles Platt that form a strongly unified portion of the south campus. Initial construction was completed in 1926, with many subsequent additions. Decorative elements include 27 art-glass windows by J. Scott Williams of New York, depicting the marks of Renaissance printers, and murals by Barry Faulkner entitled The Four Hemispheres: Polar, Celestial, Eastern, Western."
Campus,"The University's Willard Airport, named after Arthur Cutts Willard who served as University President from 1934 to 1946, has been providing airline service to the campus and east central Illinois since 1945. Located in Savoy it is one of the largest and finest university owned-and-operated airports in the country."
Campus,"The University presently counts almost 200 permanent buildings on its UIUC campus

Campus,"This paper shall focus on the UIUC campus, attempting to detail its major buildings, as well as some of its more obscure buildings and spaces, and to try and tell some of the story of how those buildings and places came to be."
Campus,"It is fascinating to look back upon the ceaseless southward expansion of campus. North campus, which was the original campus, and once the ""old campus"", has become the new campus, while the new campus has become the old. What were once the new buildings on an old campus have now become the old buildings on a new campus, with a few, like Kenny Gym and the Vivarium, the last bastions of the old campus in the midst of the new. In a way, campus has come full-circle, with the old becoming new again, as north campus has been razed and rebuilt, and as always, south campus is gradually being pushed farther south and its northern remnants razed over for other purposes. Our great Land Grant University, founded upon agriculture and wide open fields, has relentlessly pushed its heritage ever-South, covering up the land with mammoth buildings and burying away the ""treeless prairie"" from whence it sprung."

In the 1880s the institution experienced financial hardship which also resulted in the university changing names in 1885, from the Illinois Industrial University to the University of Illinois. The name change was then to avoid confusion with schools for delinquents. Then president Selim H. Peabody struggled to maintain academic standards and sell the university's lands. Peabody's methods came under attack by then students and developing alumni groups. This resulted in 1891, the Board of Trustees forced him out of office.

History,"The history of the University of Illinois is the history of over 250,000 people who have studied, taught and worked at the University and several million Illinois taxpayers who make annual investments in higher education. A democratic, land-grant institution, the University of Illinois is one of the largest state universities in the United States. John Milton Gregory came to Illinois in 1867 to organize the Illinois Industrial University as the ""West Point for the working world."" A student of a master educational innovator, Eliphalet Nott of Union College, Gregory devoted thirteen years to fashioning a university on the muddy prairie. Instruction in the liberal arts aroused the hostility of legislators and champions of ""industrial education"". Attempts at agricultural education proved premature. Most early graduates took the engineering curriculum or entered business. Gregory experimented with student government and brought an academic culture to the Illinois prairies. Most of his students were from nearby counties. Recurring clashes with trustees and students led to his resignation in 1880."
History,"The 1880's brought financial hardship to the institution. In 1885, the Illinois Industrial University became the University of Illinois to indicate the aspirations of faculty and alumni and to avoid confusion with schools for delinquents. Selim H. Peabody struggled to maintain academic standards and sell the University's lands. Peabody's strict policies came under vigorous attacks by students and developing alumni groups. In 1891, the Board of Trustees forced him out of office. Chosen by popular vote after 1887 and representing interested alumni groups, the trustees sought a strong, yet progressive administrator. In a three year search, they offered the presidency to Woodrow Wilson and Rev. Washington Gladden."
History,"While they searched, the University began a period of rapid growth under the capable guidance of Acting Regent Thomas J. Burrill. Fraternities, intercollegiate athletics and liberalization of regulations reflected the social values and interests of the students. In Andrew S. Draper, the trustees found an aggressive exponent of American values schooled in the politics of the State of New York. A successful disciplinarian and legislative lobbyist, Draper continued a building program begun in 1892, hired an able faculty and broadened the University's offerings by adding schools of law, library science and medicine. Beginning in 1889, enrollment, courses and departments began a rapid increase that has continued to the present. After 1909, a similar increase in library resources made the University Library one of the largest in the nation. The agricultural (1888) and engineering (1904) experiment stations called public attention to the University's research interests. In 1899 Dean Eugene Davenport mobilized the state's agricultural interests to put the College of Agriculture on firm footing with a $150,000 appropriation for a building. With the development of colleges, the deans allied themselves against Draper, who returned to New York in 1904."
History,"Illinoisan Edmund J. James became President in 1904. In the next sixteen years, he made a major contribution to the growth of the University. A master of public relations and legislative tactics, James secured outstanding young faculty in direct competition with other universities and won significant new appropriations from the state legislature. Midwestern state universities all grew at about the same time and rate. James brought the University of Illinois to prominence by the quality of the men he hired and the programs he began. Class rivalries and Bob Zuppke's winning football teams contributed to campus morale."
History,"Long-time administrator David Kinley served as president from 1920 to 1930. A zealous champion of the University, which he fondly referred to as ""an oasis of intellectuality in a desert of fertility,"" Kinley maintained a building program and handled increasing enrollments. The University became known as one of the strongest fraternity campuses in the country. An American response to the social, housing and governance problems accompanying mass higher education, the fraternity system reached a peak in the late 1920's under the guidance of Dean ""matriarchal, patriarchal"" Thomas Arkle Clark. Kinley's successor, President Harry W. Chase served only three years, but was able to liberalize and revise university statutes and liberalize student regulations."
History,"The severe economic depression and conservative management nearly halted building construction during President Arthur C. Willard's term from 1934 to 1946. The three exceptions were significant. When the old University Hall began to collapse in 1938, the University replaced it with Gregory Hall and the Illini Union. The Union was the first building devoted to social and service functions. The third major building project in this period were the first modern Men's Dormitories, which were built in 1941."
History,"The end of World War II opened the way for unprecedented growth and the growing pains that it brought. The percentage of the state budget allocated to higher education had fallen from 14% before World War I to 3% before World War II. The ""architect"" of the new university was George D. Stoddard. An Iowa psychologist, Stoddard appointed several young deans who soon came into conflict with veteran faculty and conservative community influences. A series of crises eventually resulted in Stoddard's dismissal by the Board of Trustees in 1953. Fired for political and ideological reasons, Stoddard's removal aroused widespread faculty concern. While alumni and legislative concern for a successful intercollegiate athletic program has usually been channeled into constructive activities, public awareness and acceptance of a broad social role for the university has been negligible. Trustees, legislators and taxpayers have seldom asked the University of Illinois to bear the responsibility for economic growth, cultural cohesion and radical social change."
History,"After a biennium under former Comptroller Lloyd Morey, the Trustees chose David D. Henry as president. With a professional presence and administrative skill, Henry accelerated the building program and presided over a period characterized by the rapid growth of the Graduate College and increased federal support of scientific and technological research and development. After World War II, state support of higher education was directed toward regional universities. Although the University remained the preeminent state-supported institution for graduate work, its proportion of the tax dollar for higher education declined from 78% in 1948 to 49% in 1968. Between 1958 and 1970, the number of dormitory units tripled. Urban commuter campuses and a junior college system represented new departures in higher education in the 1960's. In 1967, the University reorganized into Urbana-Champaign, Chicago Circle and Medical Center (Chicago) campuses under chancellors, and in 1982, the two Chicago campuses merged. The 1960's were also characterized by increasing student and faculty unrest over governance and social priorities. The state continued to supply two-thirds of the University budget, but the federal government provided nearly 90% of the income for research."
History,"Throughout its brief history of slightly more than a century, the University of Illinois has been a prominent force for social mobility and demonstrated an ability to meet changing social needs. It reflects the values of four internal and many external constituencies. Within the institution, the students, faculty, administrators and non-academic staff each shape the character of the institution. Between 1938 and 1970, its physical growth in a service-oriented economy brought a 12-fold expansion in the staff compared to a 5-fold increase in faculty. Outside influences are represented by the state legislature, trustees, benefactors, alumni, parents, employers and those who shape public opinion. The last category includes both the press, and faculty and administrators at other institutions of higher education. Once described as ""the worst of the best"" and a ""sleeping giant"" unable to overcome the problems of numbers, the University has emerged as a highly selective ""multiversity"" with over 25% of its students in graduate or professional programs. With a huge residential campus located in a small city in rural America, the University plays a unique role in the history of higher education. The history of the University of Illinois is that of students seeking emancipation, identity, qualifications for employment and knowledge; of staff seeking professional opportunity, a challenging role in a dynamic institution and a understanding of the complex and perplexing business of educating the elites which must both manage and transform society."
History,"Founded in 1948 by Dr. Tim Nugent, the Division of Disability Resources and Educational Services (DRES) was the first post secondary disability support service program in the world. DRES began as a result of Dr. Nugent’s unyielding belief that veterans injured in WWII should nevertheless be able to take advantage of the GI bill and attend college. From those early days came more than 60 years of breakthroughs and “firsts” in accessibility that include everything from wheelchair athletics to buses with wheelchair lifts to curb cuts in our streets and sidewalks."
History,"In 1944, Thomas K. Cureton became the director of the physical fitness research laboratory, one of the first of its kind in the nation. He developed methods to test motor and cardiovascular fitness and aquatic performance and to appraise the human physique. Cureton played a major role in the development of the fitness movement in America."
History,"In the late 1950s, Samuel A. Kirk established the Institute for Research on Exceptional Children, the first multi-disciplinary research unit of its kind in the world. Kirk’s research and his development of the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities led to the concept of “learning disabilities” and to new techniques of remedial education. Thanks to the early work of Kirk and his colleagues – special education was born and huge steps were taken in ensuring that everyone should have the chance to learn."
History,"Jonathan Baldwin Turner, Professor at Illinois College in Jacksonville, first proposed “A Plan for a State University for the Industrial Classes” at a meeting of the Illinois Teachers Institute on May 13, 1850, at Griggsville, Illinois. He proposed not only the foundation of a state university for the agricultural and industrial classes in Illinois, but a system in all the states of the union."
History,"At Jonathan Baldwin Turner’s urging, the farmers’ convention in Granville, Illinois on November 18, 1851, passed a resolution to the Illinois General Assembly for the creation of a state university. A second farmers’ convention in Springfield on June 8, 1852, sent a resolution to the Illinois legislature calling for “an appropriation of public lands for each State in the Union for the appropriate endowment of universities for the liberal education of the industrial classes in their several pursuits in each State of the Union.”"
History,"The State Industrial Universities Plan was chartered by the Illinois General Assembly on February 8, 1853, petitioning Congress for the establishment of national land-grants to create a system of state universities. On November 24, 1853, the Industrial League of the State of Illinois was chartered to promote the interests of the industrial classes, most notably the plan for an industrial university. The resolution of the Illinois General Assembly was introduced in the U.S. Congress on March 20, 1854, to create a system of land grant universities to cooperate with each other and with the Smithsonian Institution at Washington."
History,"A new member of the House of Representatives from one of the more populous eastern states, Justin Smith Morrill of Vermont, was entrusted by Jonathan Baldwin Turner of Illinois and other leading advocates to sponsor a bill in the U.S. Congress to establish a system of state land-grant universities, which was first introduced on December 14, 1857."
History,"An Industrial University Convention, called by the State Agricultural Society, was held in Bloomington on December 4, 1865, proposing to the Illinois General Assembly that a single university should be established in Illinois in accordance with the Morrill Act and first proposed a location in Champaign County."
History,"A bill passed the Illinois General Assembly on February 25, 1867, authorizing the creation of an Illinois Industrial University. On February 28, 1867, Governor Richard J. Oglesby signed the Griggs Bill into effect, granting the Illinois Industrial University its charter. After an official commission received bids from four counties, the communities of Champaign and Urbana in Champaign County were chosen by an act of the Illinois General Assembly on March 8, 1867. The decision alienated some of the original supporters of the movement, including Professor Turner. On Tuesday, March 12, 1867, the Board of Trustees of the Illinois Industrial University met for the first time, electing John Milton Gregory as the first Regent of the University. Gregory developed plans that included departments of Agriculture, Polytechnic, Military, Chemical and Natural Sciences, General Sciences and Literature, and Trade and Commerce."
History,"The Illinois Industrial University opened its doors on March 2, 1868, with three faculty members. The first student, James Newton Matthews of Mason, Illinois, enrolled in agriculture, later earning a medical degree and practicing medicine.On March 11, 1868, Willard Flagg Bliss was named the first professor of agriculture."
History,"A model farm house was constructed on the campus experiment station and came to be known as Mumford House. Professor Thomas J. Burrill was the first resident, and the house was later occupied by three deans of agriculture, George E. Morrow, Eugene Davenport, and Herbert W. Mumford. It is the oldest remaining structure on the University of Illinois campus and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places."
History,"Thomas J. Burrill was an early professor of botany and applied plant sciences during the nascent stages of development for these disciplines in North America. Burrill was known nationally and abroad for his work in botany and applied plant sciences including tree cultivation and management. His original research was on the bacterial causes for plant and fruit disease, and it led to the development of preventative treatment methods, the first major conceptual advance by an American in the developing field of plant pathology. Burrill served as University of Illinois President from 1891 to 1894."
History,"In 1871 pioneering research on the culture and use of trees in Illinois for economic benefit was instituted with the establishment of an experimental plantation (formerly The forestry, with remaining portion now called the Illini Grove) that predates the more famous Morrow Plots, the first agricultural experimental fields in North America. Also in 1871 the earliest forestry course to be offered in the United States was initiated by Thomas Jay Burrill, a pioneer in the developing field of plant pathology."
History,"At a convention in Chicago of 12 state colleges called the Friends of Agricultural Education, W.C. Flagg proposed the founding of agricultural experiment stations as adjuncts to the state land-grant universities. Mr. Flagg was a prominent agricultural and political leader and a trustee of the Illinois Industrial University from its founding until his death in 1878."
History,"Nathan Clifford Ricker claimed to have received a great practical training by apprenticing for a Chicago architect shortly after the Great Fire. In 1872, he brought practical knowledge to the UI where he taught perhaps the first course in the nation in graphic statistics. Ricker was a pioneer in advanced structural design. His work contributed to the rise of the steel- skeleton skyscrapers that changed the face of the American city."
History,"University Fine Arts Gallery (the predecessor to Krannert Art Museum), housed in University Hall on the Champaign-Urbana campus of the University of Illinois, opens to the public to present the art collections of the university formed by John Milton Gregory, who served as its first regent from 1867 to 1880."
History,"The first sixteen master’s degrees were awarded in 1878. These earliest master’s degrees were awarded to people who took additional undergrad-level courses beyond the requirements for the undergrad degree. These degrees were often awarded to faculty. There was an ongoing debate throughout the late 19th century about what constituted graduate work. Two different systems emerged. The first, residential graduate students, required one year of advanced study and submission of a thesis. The second required a period of professional activity – typically 3 years."
History,"In 1892, the Graduate School was established to ensure the high quality of graduate degree programs and to provide fellowship support for enterprising students who sought advanced degrees. To do this, the Graduate School was charged with overseeing degree requirements for advanced study and providing administrative structure. The first fellowships for graduate study included an annual stipend of $400. Four fellowships were awarded in 1892. These were awarded to Alice May Barber, Herman S. Piatt, Howard W. Woodworth, Mrs. Lucile Hall Parr. The Graduate School was formally inaugurated in 1907. Forty years later, the name was changed to the Graduate College. Today the Graduate College has oversight for 156 master’s programs and 91 doctoral programs in a wide range of disciplines."
History,"The forerunner of the Division of Intercollegiate Athletics (DIA), the University of Illinois Athletic Association, was chartered in 1892 as a not-for-profit corporation of the State of Illinois. It was charged with overseeing and conducting the University's intercollegiate athletics programs and associated support services, and operated as as separate entity."
History,"The library science program at the Armour Institute of Technology in Chicago was founded in 1893. From 1893 to 1907, Katharine Lucinda Sharp served as University librarian and founding director of the Department of Library Science, as recommended by American librarian, educator, and inventor of the Dewey Decimal system, Melvil Dewey. In 1897, the Department of Library Science was moved to Urbana and renamed the Illinois State Library School."
History,"Psychology at Illinois has had a long and distinguished history. The first record of a professor of psychology on campus is 1890. There was no separate Psychology Department at that time, but Dr. Charles De Garmo taught educational psychology and mental science under the Department of Philosophy and Pedagogy. A Psychological Laboratory was first established on campus in 1892 by Professor William O. Krohn. The following year the Psychology Department was established as a separate department from Philosophy with Professor Krohn in charge."
History,"Eugene Davenport succeeded George Morrow as the dean of the College of Agriculture on January 1, 1895. The Illinois Farmers’ Institute was created by an act of the General Assembly on June 24, 1895, to promote among the people and before the legislature the interests of farmers and of the College of Agriculture."
History,"The Illinois State Water Survey (ISWS) was founded as a part of the University of Illinois Chemistry Department in 1895 to survey the waters of Illinois to trace the spread of water-borne diseases. Chemical analyses of water samples were performed by Professor Arthur W. Palmer. Realizing the importance of clean drinking water, Palmer set initial survey goals of determining sanitary conditions of the state's water supplies and setting local standards of purity. He then recommended that the scope of the work be expanded, and the Illinois General Assembly provided funding to establish the State Water Survey as an institution."
History,"Dean Eugene Davenport mobilized the state’s agricultural interests to put the College of Agriculture on firm footing with a $150,000 appropriation for a building. The Funk Bill, promising more funding and an appropriation for the agricultural building, was passed against the wishes of President Draper. In 1900, the construction of a new College of Agriculture Building, later renamed Davenport Hall, contributed to the growth and expansion of the College."
History,"Cyril George Hopkins became head of the Department of Agronomy, and his groundbreaking corn breeding work improved the chemistry of the corn kernel. He later launched the Illinois System of Permanent Soil Fertility and determined that phosphate, limestone, and organic matter are needed for soil health, as is the annual rotation among crops."
History,"The Department of Chemical Engineering (now Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering) was founded in 1901 by Samuel Parr. It is one of the oldest chemical engineering departments in the nation. Parr developed standard methods for measuring the quality of coal and invented the Parr calorimeter, which is still used today for measuring the heating value of fuels."
History,"On July 6, 1901 the Board of Trustees approved the expenditure of $250 to purchase squirrels for campus. In the recommendation in referring to why the campus needed squirrels it says 'If successful, the influence upon University life, and upon the feelings of students, would be considerable, and students would carry that influence to all parts of the State.'"
History,"The first Accounting course is offered as part of the Economics curriculum, taught by the Comptroller of the University and other accountants in that office. An organized program of business is reborn as The Courses of Training for Business with David Kinley acting as Director, and the university begins offering the first college-level courses in Business English."
History,"Illinois' Chemistry Building opened as the largest single chemical laboratory in the world, and the first interdisciplinary research institute in chemistry. Over the next century, eight Nobel laureates receive their training there. In 1939, it was renamed in honor of William Albert Noyes, a legendary professor of organic chemistry and head of the Department of Chemistry from 1907 to 1926."
History,"In 1910, Elizabeth Ruth Bennett became the first female to receive a mathematics PhD from the University of Illinois. Her thesis was titled “Primitive groups of degree 20,” written under the direction of G.A. Miller. The Elizabeth R. Bennett Scholarship in Mathematics at the University of Illinois was established in 1974 for undergraduate mathematics major students by Elizabeth Bennett’s bequest. Bennett Scholarships are still being given to this day."
History,"The first U of I Homecoming celebration was conceived in 1909 by students C.F. Williams and Elmer Ekblaw, members of the Shield and Trident senior society. The center of the three-day celebration was the Illinois-Chicago football game on Oct. 15, 1910. More than 1,500 graduates returned to Champaign-Urbana at the original Homecoming--one-third of all graduates at the time. Illinois defeated Chicago 3-0 on a drop-kick by Otto Seiler."

History,"The Senior Memorial Chime was installed in the Library Hall (now Altgeld Hall) tower in 1920. The chime was a gift of the classes of 1914-1921. The small room at the base of the tower was converted into the chime playing room, housing the playing and practice consoles, still in use today. In 1921 the automatic chime mechanism, controlled by a Seth Thomas clock, a gift of the Class of 1922, was installed in a small room on the roof of the playing room. The chimes were dedicated on homecoming weekend October 30, 1920."
History,"Joseph Tykosinki-Tykociner arrived at the University of Illinois in 1921. By March 1922, he had finally created his first talkie, and his demonstration depicted Tykociner's wife, Helena, ringing a bell and saying, ""I will ring,"" after which she asked the audience, ""Did you hear the bell ring?"" On June 9, 1922, Professor Tykociner gave the first-ever demonstration of sound on film in the Physics Building on the Illinois campus. Tykociner had produced what is called a variable density soundtrack along one side of the same film that records the picture images, thereby ensuring that pictures and sound would be synchronized. This achievement made international headlines and forever changed the way the world watched and heard motion pictures."
History,"The Great Depression was hard for everyone living at the time in this country, but the lasting effects continued to be seen for years and years to come. It's interesting to see campus life during a time of such struggle. Sadness, loss, and squalor were all present here, but so was happiness, youth, and joy. It's amazing to see the resilience in people's faces in the pictures. The diary of a young student showed how tight his finances were. Roger Ebert retells of the sadness which echoed on campus when the chimes of Altgeld Hall chimed no more. All can be seen in this collection brought to you by The Student Life and Culture Archives and created by Justin C. Williams, a practicum student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign completing his M.S. in Library and Information Science. Depression Era Exhibit"
History,"The Illini Union building officially opened on February 8, 1941. The final cost was $1.4 million. In the same year, the Illini Union Board formed out of the Illinois Union Advisory Committee and the Men's and Women's Leagues. For the first anniversary in 1942, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt attended and cut the cake."
History,"Established after World War II, the Antenna Lab achieved breakthroughs in antenna bandwidth, enabling the spread of television as well as advances in radio astronomy, radar, and space communications. Most of the innovations were enabled by the then-radical idea, credited to Professor Vic Rumsey, that antennas defined by angles rather than lengths could be sized independently of their operating frequency. By embodying Rumsey’s angular concept in an array of discrete elements, Professor Raymond DuHamel (BSEE ’47, MSEE ’48, PhD ’51) and student Dwight Isbell paved the way to “log-periodic” designs that became popular TV receivers."
History,"The Applied Health Sciences Library was established in 1949 as the Physical Education Library. It was located in rooms 104 and 106 of the Main Library, because that was the midway between the male and female gymnasiums. The library began with 4,000 volumes and a capacity for 48 patrons. The director of the School of Physical Education, Dr. Seward C. Staley, was instrumental in the opening of the library by aiding in collection building and securing space for the library when the first doctoral degree was awarded to a physical education student in 1949."
History,"Physics Professor Ralph E. Meagher and colleagues developed ILLIAC I, the first digital computer entirely built and owned by an educational institution. ILLIAC I became operational on September 22, 1952. It used 2,800 vacuum tubes, and measured ten feet high, two feet wide, and eight and a half feet tall. It was used by Lajaren Hiller, director of the Experimental Music Studios, to compose and play the ILLIAC Suite, the first computer-composed composition. ILLIAC progressed through five generations, securing Illinois’ reputation as the leader in the field of largescale, high-performance computing. Each new ILLIAC incorporated innovations in architecture, memory, logic, and software that spread throughout the computer world. The ILLIAC series culminated in the mid 1960s with the ILLIAC IV supercomputer at the time the fastest and largest in the world."
History,"In 1956 the Department of Mathematics made Altgeld Hall their permanent home. The final addition, constructed in 1956-57, created classrooms along the east side of the building, resulting in the blocking of many windows of the original structure and the enclosure of the East Reading Room. The skylight that had been over the stained glass dome was also removed at that time."
History,"Krannert Art Museum opens, allowing for the permanent art collection to be cared for and exhibited alongside presentations of faculty work and traveling exhibitions.

History,"Commerce West, named because of its position directly west of David Kinley Hall, opens. The 98,000-square-foot building houses classroom space, 100 offices, a 350-seat auditorium, and an IBM computer. The fourth floor, dedicated to faculty and graduate offices, has no womens restroom because there are no female staff or graduate students at the time. The cost of the building is $3.3 million."
History,"Krannert Center, designed by Illinois graduate Max Abramovitz, opened in April 1969 to high praise during its month-long dedication. A critic for The New York Times called the facility “one of the most ingeniously worked out art complexes anywhere,” and a writer for the Christian Science Monitor noted that “the performing arts now have a home equal to the gilded science-palaces that adorn other campuses.” Today, Krannert Center is recognized as the nation’s premier university-based performing arts center."
History,"In September of 1969, the Board of Trustees approved naming the recently acquired building at 801 S. Wright Street after the late Arthur B. Coble. Dr. Coble was a professor of mathematics for 39 years and served as head of the department from 1933 until retirement in 1947. He died in 1966 at the age of 88. In addition to his work as teacher and administrator, he was the author of many articles, which earned him distinction as a mathematician and pre-eminence in the field of algebraic geometry. His election to the National Academy of Sciences recognized his achievement in the field of algebraic geometry. Dr. Coble also served as president of the American Mathematical Society. Before the building was owned by the University, it had been a YWCA, serving as a meeting pace and a residence for women students. Today, Coble Hall is home to the Graduate College."
History,"From the Daily Illini - August 23, 2013 - While Quad Day has now become a staple during Welcome Week, it started as a completely different event over 40 years ago. In September 1971, the Office of Student Programs and the Illini Union teamed up to host the first official Quad Day to welcome new students to campus. In the midst of building war tensions throughout the nation's colleges and universities, the purpose of Quad Day was in part to show freshmen that the University could be a home away from home and to inform them of the different support services available to them. The inaugural event featured a talent show, a hot dog stand, and a student/faculty volleyball game. 7,000 were in attendance."

Academics,"Social science is the study of individuals, relationships, and institutions in human societies, past and present. Social scientists investigate phenomena from the working of neurons in the brain to the behavior of socially situated individuals; from interactions among groups like families, communities, organizations, and governments, to large-scale patterns of international trade, alliance, and conflict. They engage vital normative questions—such as the relationship between freedom and morality, or the responsibilities of citizens in a democratic polity—by examining and debating classical and contemporary ideas in social thought and political philosophy, and they employ a wide variety of empirical research methodologies, from laboratory studies and field experiments to interviews and ethnography; from surveys to the analysis of existing administrative data from record-keeping systems (e.g., on taxation, health care utilization, social media usage, and other transactions)."
Academics,"The Division of Social Science within the Faculty of Arts and Sciences consists of ten departments and degree programs (including the four most popular undergraduate concentrations at Harvard), as well as nearly two dozen research centers, museums, and institutes, with more than 250 affiliated faculty (including two
Pulitzer winners
, five
Nobelists
, and eleven of the twenty-five
University Professors
across Harvard)."
Academics,"These concentrations consider big questions about peoples and societies past and present, and investigate phenomena large and small – the minds and brains of socially situated people; groups like families, communities, organizations, and governments; and large-scale patterns of international trade, alliance, and conflict. Several social science concentrations engage vital normative questions about timeless issues – such as the relationship between freedom and morality, or the responsibilities of citizens in a democratic polity – by examining and debating classical and contemporary ideas in social thought and political philosophy."
Academics,"Social scientists study their subjects systematically by conducting a wide variety of empirical re- search. They acquire data using ingenious methods, including laboratory experiments, field experiments that intervene in real-life settings, sample surveys, documentary evidence, and administrative data from record-keeping systems for tracking taxation, health care utilization, social media usage, and other transactions. They employ more qualitative methods like participant observation, in-depth interviewing, and ethnography to elicit an interpretative understanding of what social events and phenomena mean from the standpoint of research subjects."
Academics,"By learning the research methods used in their fields, social science concentrators prepare themselves for a variety of post-College futures. Most professional education requires the ability to distill conclusions from complex bodies of information; many rewarding careers have similar requisites. Concentrating in a social science field helps students to gain such skills, along with critical reading, clear expository writing, speaking articulately, and learning to synthesize diverse perspectives and ideas. A senior thesis research project – an option in all social science concentrations, and a requirement in Social Studies – is a rewarding experience by itself, and an excellent way to combine and enhance these skills. Participating in a laboratory group or serving as an assistant to a faculty project can also help to develop them."
Academics,"While no social science concentration offers pre-professional training, all offer an excellent liberal arts foundation for post-graduate study in education, law, management, medicine, and other professions. Social science concentrators also enter careers in business, journalism, and public service, and a few opt for research careers in university or non-academic settings."

Academics,"This is CS50, Harvard University’s introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming, for concentrators and non-concentrators alike, with or without prior programming experience. (Two thirds of CS50 students have never taken CS before.) This course teaches you how to solve problems, both with and without code, with an emphasis on correctness, design, and style. Topics include computational thinking, abstraction, algorithms, data structures, and computer science more generally. Problem sets inspired by the arts, humanities, social sciences, and sciences. More than teach you how to program in one language, this course teaches you how to program fundamentally and how to teach yourself new languages ultimately. The course starts with a traditional but omnipresent language called C that underlies today’s newer languages, via which you’ll learn not only about functions, variables, conditionals, loops, and more, but also about how computers themselves work underneath the hood, memory and all. The course then transitions to Python, a higher-level language that you’ll understand all the more because of C. Toward term’s end, the course introduces SQL, via which you can store data in databases, along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, via which you can create web and mobile apps alike. Course culminates in a final project."

Alumni,"Harvard’s Class of 2020 is graduating into an unprecedented job market — while many are sticking to similar career choices as previous classes, measurably higher numbers are graduating with uncertainty. Like previous graduating classes, most seniors plan to live on the coasts and many will hold jobs in the consulting, finance, and technology industries."
Alumni,"A majority of students — 61 percent — will enter the workforce in their first year after graduation. This is a slight drop from last year, when 64 percent of students took jobs after graduation. Fourteen percent will attend graduate or professional school and 7 percent will pursue fellowships. In the midst of the COVID-19 outbreak, an unusually high 18 percent of students are undecided, and fewer than 1 percent of seniors will travel after graduation."
Alumni,"Three industries reigned supreme among Harvard seniors’ post-graduate plans. Of respondents planning to enter the workforce, a majority — 63 percent — indicated they would go into consulting, finance, or technology. Consulting and finance each drew 22 percent and 23 percent of students entering the workforce, respectively, while 18 percent indicated they would be entering technology sector jobs."
Alumni,"A healthy majority of graduating seniors — 67 percent — who are taking jobs will be making more than $70,000 dollars during their first year out of college, well above the national average for starting salaries for college degree-holders, which hovers around $50,000. There are still significant gender disparities, however, between higher and lower paying positions."

Campus,"Whether you’re a new Harvard student starting your school year, or visiting Harvard University on a campus tour, there is so much to discover. My lovely university is a heaven for students, tourists and photographers alike. During my time at Harvard, I got plenty of visitors, both friends and family. And for everyone, it was an overwhelming experience taking in all the beauty of our breathtaking campus."
Campus,"Harvard University is one of the most visited places in Boston, and even all of East Coast. A Harvard University tour is a memorable experience, since every visitor has seen parts of the campus either in movies, pictures or places that have been inspired by Harvard architecture."
Campus,"Harvard University is full of new and old buildings, beautiful architecture and iconic spots to take your pictures. Of course, some of the best places at Harvard are reserved for the students, so if you aren’t one, it’s best to visit with a student or during the Open House."
Campus,"Harvard Square may not be the most iconic place at Harvard if you’re just googling images of the university. But for every student and visitor, this is where the tour starts. Harvard has a whole T station (metro, subway or underground) dedicated to it, called Harvard Square, which can be the starting point of your Harvard university tour. It’s also the meeting point if you ever lose your tour partners!"
Campus,"Located at the junction of John F. Kennedy Street and Massachusetts Avenue is the building of Cambridge Savings Bank, which has become something of a landmark over the years. Along with this building, other structures and shops such as bookstores, toy stores, and a Bank of America also surround Harvard Square."
Campus,"Harvard Square is unmissable, central and is the congregation point, where students run into old friends, meet new acquaintances and grab a bite to eat. The most popular and central spot is Starbucks, below the Cambridge Savings Bank, which is right at the corner of Mass Ave, and opened while I was a student at Harvard. Right outside is the Cambridge Visitor’s Information Center booth."

Campus,"The green space between undergraduate dormitories is called Harvard Yard, which is enclosed by iron fences, walls and gates. Harvard Yard is the most iconic place at Harvard University, and is a must on any Harvard campus tour."
Campus,"It is one of the oldest areas that became a part of Harvard University in the late 1600s, housing Harvard College dorms. Now it is also home to the famous John Harvard Statue, where you can see throngs of tourists taking pictures every time, everyday, touching his shoe to take pictures."
Campus,"Harvard Yard is spread over 25 acres (10 ha) and it’s boundaries have 25 gates, opening at Mass Ave, Science Center. The yard is also home to libraries and memorial church, where the Harvard graduation ceremony takes place annually."
Campus,"This is right in the part of Harvard Yard that is behind the John Harvard statue (called Tercentenary Theater). Widener library is the oldest one at Harvard University. And it’s the largest private and university-owned library in the United States. It is home to 3.5 million books, countless stacks and all types of reading spaces."
Campus,"Also called Mem Hall or just ‘Mem’, the building used to be the background of the John Harvard Statue in the early 1920s and before. Mem Hall houses three parts: Sanders Theater, Annenberg Hall and Memorial Transept."
Campus,"Memorial Transept is a vault that anyone can enter, and is serves as the congregation space for Sanders Theater. It has a high vaulted ceiling and large stained-glass windows above the entrance on either side. Great place to take pictures, if only it were better lit. Either way, it’s an important one to include in your Harvard campus tour."
Campus,"Located north of Harvard Yard, Science Center is home to the computer labs, classrooms and science library for undergraduates. The first floor also houses a nice cafe where I frequently lunched."
Campus,"To someone expecting the classic Harvard style of architecture, Science Center is not much to look at. In fact, not even many Harvard students find it pretty. That’s because it was constructed in the ’70s, amid the modernist movement, when designers sought to do something different than the existing antiquated Georgian architectural style."
Campus,"The plaza in front of the Science Center is home to the beautiful Tanner fountain, where kids are often found playing and water-splashing! Students often put up Yard sales, College club events and protest rallies there. Oftentimes, you can also find food-trucks, farmers’ markets and even Quidditch practices there."
Campus,"Harvard Law School (HLS) is located near the northwest of the Harvard Yard. The HLS library is a beautiful old building with a big yard in front of it. Named Langdell Hall, it is immediately recognizable with its large windows, columns and Harvardian architecture style."
Campus,"Located north of the Science Center and near the graduate dorms, the Natural History Museum is a great place where many students don’t even go throughout their time at Harvard! Although admission is open only to Harvard community."
Campus,"Located north of the Harvard campus, the Radcliffe Quad, or just “Quad”, is not much of a touristy spot, but is a great place to visit if you’re a Harvard graduate student and looking to explore the campus. The Radcliffe Quadrangle houses the Quad green and undergraduate dormitories, including the oft-photographed Cabot house and Pforzheimer house."
Campus,"The Harvard Stadium is south of the campus, across from HBS. The world-renowned stadium was built in 1903, and is a National Historic Landmark. It’s an essential part of any Harvard campus tour."
Campus,"The Charles river is an iconic body that divides the main Harvard campus. The north part of the campus on the north of Charles is the Cambridge campus, that borders at Memorial Drive. And the southern one is Allston campus, that starts at Soldiers Field Road. These two are connected by the Anderson Memorial Bridge, which is the perfect spot to take pictures and view both sides. It’s a must-see spot when visiting Harvard and MIT."
Campus,"The space next to Memorial Drive is where you’ll see the bike path, students lounging around after classes, and skateboarders. The John F. Kennedy Memorial Park is right next to it, featuring a fountain. And while you’re here, also walk around to discover tiny lanes, tree-lined avenues. If you’re on a self-guided harvard tour, walk west, and enjoy a quiet cappuccino at Darwin’s, or go up north to have a cup of tea at Pete’s Cafe."
Campus,"Right from across the river, you’ll see the iconic Baker Library, a world-famous building. It has the best place to take a picture at Harvard – in the HBS yard, with Baker Library forming the backdrop. And if you want one with the Harvard sign, check out the HBS sign at the back entrance."
Campus,"The next spot to check out is Spangler Center, which is the student center. A relatively new building, Spangler has the same Georgian architecture style that the old Harvard buildings have. Inside is a massive student lounge that’s actually the last place I can concentrate in, because it seems a bit daunting."
Campus,"The Plaza at

History,"1780:
The Massachusetts Constitution went into effect and officially recognized Harvard as a university. The first medical instruction given to Harvard students in 1781 and the founding of the Medical School in 1782 made it a university in fact as well as name."

, around which
Harvard University
eventually grew, was founded in 1636 in
Cambridge, Massachusetts

History,"For centuries, its graduates dominated Massachusetts' clerical and civil ranks and beginning in the 19th century its stature became national, then international, as a dozen graduate and professional schools were formed alongside the nucleus undergraduate College. Historically influential in national roles are the schools of
medicine
(1782),
law
(1817) and
business
(1908) as well as the
Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences

History,"With some 17,000
Puritans
migrating to New England by 1636, Harvard was founded in anticipation of the need for training clergy for the new commonwealth, a ""church in the wilderness"". Harvard was established in 1636 by vote of the Great and General Court of the
Massachusetts Bay Colony
. In 1638, the school received a printing press—the only press at the time in what is now the United States, until Harvard acquired a second in 1659.

History,"The colony charter creating the
Harvard Corporation
was granted in 1650 at the beginning of the
English Interregnum
. When the college's first president
Henry Dunster
abandoned Puritanism in favor of the English
Baptist
faith in 1654, he provoked a controversy that highlighted two distinct approaches to dealing with dissent in the
Massachusetts Bay Colony
. The colony's Puritan leaders, whose own religion was born of dissent from mainstream Church of England, generally worked for reconciliation with members who questioned matters of Puritan theology, but responded much more harshly to outright rejection of Puritanism."
History,"Dunster's conflict with the colony's magistrates began when he failed to have his infant son baptized, believing as an adherent of the
Believers baptism
of English Baptists and/or
Anabaptists
that only adults should be baptized. Efforts to restore Dunster to Puritan orthodoxy failed and his apostasy proved untenable to colony leaders who had entrusted him in his job as Harvard's president to uphold the colony's religious mission, thus he represented a threat to the stability of society. Dunster exiled himself in 1654 and moved to nearby
Plymouth Colony

History,"In 1692, the leading Puritan divine
Increase Mather
became president of Harvard. One of his acts was replacing pagan classics with books by Christian authors in ethics classes and maintaining a high standard of discipline. The Harvard ""Lawes"" of 1642 and the ""Harvard College Laws of 1700"" testify to its original high level of discipline.
Students were required to observe rules of pious decorum inconceivable in the 19th century and ultimately to prove their fitness for the bachelor's degree by showing that they could ""read the original of the Old and New Testament into the Latin tongue, and resolve them logically"". [8]"
History,"The
town of Dedham
was founded in 1636, the same year as the college. The first minister of the
First Church and Parish in Dedham

Given its population and modest means, the support the community provided to the college was generous. [10]"
History,"During Harvard's early years, the town of Cambridge maintained order on campus and provided economic support, as the local
Puritan
minister had direct oversight of Harvard and ensured the orthodoxy of its leadership. By 1700, Harvard was strong enough to regulate and discipline its own people and to a large extent the direction in which support and assistance flowed was reversed, Harvard now providing financial support for local economic expansion, improvements to public health and construction of local roads,

At its inception, this university's name was ""New College,"" and its purpose was mainly to educate clergy. In 1639, the school's name became Harvard University, so named for the Rev. John Harvard. Harvard bequeathed half of his estate and his entire library to the school upon his death. This significant bequest led the school to honor him by taking his name."
History,"During the colonial era, Harvard utilized a curriculum that focused on rote learning by repeated drilling. This style of learning conformed to the typical teaching styles of this period. The university kept a small faculty, but the professors had illustrious reputations as some of the most learned men of this era. In 1782, Harvard added medical studies to the school's programs. Some buildings still standing on the university grounds originated in the 18th century. Massachusetts Hall was built in 1720, and Wadsworth House was built in 1726. The original buildings from the 17th century did not survive; however, the school marks their locations with brass markers."
History,"Harvard University added additional programs during the 19th century, namely law in 1816 and divinity in 1817. Harvard celebrated its bicentennial birthday during the 19th century. On the school's 200th birthday, then-President Josiah Quincy publicly displayed the school's new shield with the motto ""Veritas"" for the first time. The school adopted this shield officially in 1843. Quincy was Harvard's 15th president, and he kept this office between the years of 1829 and 1845. The school's teaching methods evolved during this era also. Harvard began offering more classes and a greater variety, allowing students more freedom to choose their classes. Lectures replaced the recitation teaching style as well."
History,"In 1910, Harvard officially adopted crimson as the school color. This color choice originated in the mid-1800s when two students on the rowing team provided crimson scarves to everyone on the team to enable the crowd to pick them out more easily. The idea of school colors was in its infancy then, and the school did not officially vote on this designation until more than a half-century later."
History,"Harvard presidents during the 20th century sought to center its focus on applied learning. President A. Lawrence Lowell worked tirelessly on a new system of ""concentration and distribution."" This system was designed to help students choose their fields of study more efficiently to enable them to learn and progress more effectively in their courses of study. Lowell also prioritized scholarships and honor programs. During the 20th century, Harvard University also offered more financial aid opportunities to students, increasing the diversity of the student population."

Student Life,"Harvard College
has several types of social clubs. These are split between gender-inclusive clubs recognized by the college, and unrecognized single-gender clubs which were subject to College sanctions in the past. The
Hasty Pudding Club
holds claim as the oldest collegiate social club in America, tracing its roots back to 1770.
[1]
The next oldest institutions, dating to 1791, are the traditionally all-male final clubs. Fraternities were prominent in the late 19th century as well, until their initial expulsions and then eventual resurrection off Harvard's campus in the 1990s. From 1991 onwards, all-female final clubs as well as sororities began to appear. Between 1984 and 2018, no social organizations were recognized by the school due to the clubs' refusal to become gender-inclusive.
[2]"
Student Life,"“
The category of Recognized Social Organization (RSO) is designed to support organizations comprised primarily of Harvard College undergraduates, whose purpose is primarily social and which do not discriminate on the basis of gender. Becoming an RSO is an important milestone marking a group's commitment to becoming an inclusive community aligned with the educational mission and values of Harvard College. Through recognition the College is verifying a social organization's gender-inclusivity and therefore ensuring students (of the Class of 2021 and later) who belong to RSOs have full access to leadership positions and fellowship opportunities at the College.
”"
Student Life,"RSOs are independent and distinct from Harvard University. In recognizing an RSO, Harvard College is not adopting its goals, activities, or points of view. Provided that an RSO meets certain requirements, however, the College will verify that an RSO is not an Unrecognized Single Gender Social Organization for purposes of the May 2016 social organization policy. In addition, RSOs will be eligible for certain privileges to support their function as positive and inclusive social spaces at Harvard College. The provision of such privileges does not mean a RSO is a unit of the University, or controlled by the University. These privileges are contingent on a RSO’s compliance with all policies outlined for all recognized student organizations. Certain of these policies include that the University is not responsible for a RSOs contracts or other acts or omissions. RSOs, especially those who own or rent space, are therefore encouraged to carry appropriate insurance. RSOs do not qualify for the use of the University’s taxpayer identification number or tax-exempt status in connection with purchases and sales, gifts to the RSO, or any other activity."

Student Life,"Most landlords require tenants to sign a lease, a legally binding contract outlining the conditions that both the landlord and the tenant agree to meet. Leases are usually for one year, although it may be possible to arrange a lease for a shorter period of time. Before signing any lease, one should understand everything in it. Signing a lease commits a tenant to paying the amount of rent specified on the lease every month for the duration of the lease, whether one occupies the apartment or not."
Student Life,"Landlords may ask for the first and last month's rent when one signs a lease. Some will also require a security deposit (usually equal to one month's rent). The security deposit will be returned to the tenant when the lease ends, provided that there has been no damage to the property. For the tenant's protection, the landlord should document (in writing) any damage that existed before the tenant moves into the apartment. The landlord is required by law to put the security deposit in a special account (called an escrow account). Within 10 days of receipt of the deposit, the landlord must give the tenant in writing the name and address of the bank, and the account number where the tenant's security deposit has been placed."
Student Life,"It is important to find out whether or not the rental price of an apartment or house covers utilities and heat (oil, electricity or gas). Cold water usage for apartments is usually included in the rent. The prospective tenant should ask the landlord which type of heat is being used and which company to contact to arrange for service. You can get an estimate of the monthly utility bills by calling the respective companies. If utilities are paid separately, the tenant will be charged monthly for gas and electricity. If your heat is provided through oil, you will usually need to pay for the oil at the time of oil delivery."
Student Life,"Most apartments are furnished with either gas or electric cooking stoves. Please be certain that the pilot light of a gas stove, which automatically ignites the burners, is always burning. If the burners do not light when turned on or if there is an odor of gas, the pilot light should be checked immediately by the gas company. A refrigerator may or may not be included in an apartment. You can lease a refrigerator from
Harvard Student Agencies

Student Life,"Apartment buildings may have coin-operated washing machines and dryers in the building. Also, many neighborhoods have laundromats with coin-operated washers and dryers.

Student Life,"Anyone living in a rented apartment should consider having personal property insurance to cover both property loss and personal liability (protection against any person sustaining an injury or loss in the apartment). Such insurance covers personal liability even when one is not home. The usual coverage for personal liability is up to $100,000; this amount can be increased to $500,000 with little extra cost. When discussing coverage with an insurance representative, you should mention any special conditions such as subletting, roommate coverage, or additional coverage for expensive items such as jewelry, computers, or other equipment. Personal liability and renters insurance may be obtained through private brokers."

to launch a campaign
to convince Congress to pass legislation that would imperil Harvard’s ability to enforce its sanctions. The social groups retained Arnold & Porter, a tony D.C. lobbying firm with a fearsome reputation and a long list of contacts inside the federal government, to further its cause."
Student Life,"There’s an overwhelmingly negative connotation associated with college Greek life, which fairly arises from the too frequently heard about news articles of hazing gone wrong. Although the behavior concomitant with such tragedies are inexcusable, it isn’t the defining factor of Greek life. The Greek system still exists nationally and I believe the reason it continues thriving lies in the fact that there are endless (literally! The alumni networks are as massive as whales!) positive influences it can have on a member’s life."
Student Life,"I can personally attest to these benefits – connecting to a new support group, feeling more connected to campus, and expanding study groups – and that’s why my involvement in Harvard Greek life progressively dives deeper. This semester, I’ve been transitioning into my new role of
Panhellenic Council
Vice President of Philanthropy! Although I
hate
admitting that I have a natural tendency to snap at good news, I love the new opportunities my role avails to me – like participating in
Relay for Life
, an incredibly inspiring and national event to support those fighting cancer."
Student Life,"Three male fraternities and three female sororities exist at Harvard (although not officially acknowledged due to the institution’s rule against recognizing single gender groups):
Alpha Epsilon Pi
,
Sigma Chi
,
Sigma Alpha Epsilon
,
Kappa Alpha Theta
,
Kappa Kappa Gamma
, and
Delta Gamma
, respectively. Over the course of these last few months, representatives from each group met with me to organize fundraising events for the annual
Harvard Relay for Life
. Each year the
Harvard Greek Team
raises thousands of dollars for the amazing cause through personal appeals as well as creative ways, some of them exemplified below:"
Student Life,"Date Auction
: The
Cambridge Queen’s Head
(a restaurant/pub) located in the basement of Annenberg (the freshman cafeteria commonly referenced to as the Great Hall from
Harry Potter
) graciously donated their stage to the Harvard Greek community to hold a date auction for two hours. Twenty generous and studly fraternity brothers of Harvard volunteered themselves to be auctioned. Girls across campus (even some graduate students!) came to bid for a magical hour with these men, 100% of proceeds going directly for Relay for Life. The “Date Contract” read that the men had to be at their utmost gentlemanly behavior…but we’ll just see how my two dates go before we get excited. Yes, I did buy two. Hey now, it was for charity!!"
Student Life,"Greek life. Phew. It’s a hot topic on every college campus, and everyone has questions about it. How many people are in it? What’s the ~vibe~? Am I paying for friends? Do I have to be in it to have a college experience? Is it worth it? Also why is it called Greek Life when “fraternity” and “sorority” are Latin derived? Do they serve Mediterranean cuisine?"

Academics,"There are three basic methods by which social scientists subject hypotheses to tests against evidence: 1) lab or field experiments; 2) statistical analysis; and 3) comparative history. Each of these methods has its advantages, but many of the big questions of social science research--such as why some countries are characterized by persistent autocracy, while others are characterized by stable democracy—lend themselves to large scale, comparative historical research."
Academics,"The comparative historical approach to hypothesis testing is often called Big History, and its methods of analysis draw from other fields of inquiry that rely on observational data to understand the factors that shape complex systems, and that shift those systems from one equilibrium to another. Examples include fields such as medicine, epidemiology, astronomy, and evolutionary biology. These disciplines must employ multi-dimensional analyses, and one of the key dimensions is time. Doing so allows researchers in these fields to rule out hypotheses because they are inconsistent with the timing of events (e.g., if A happened after B, then A could not have caused B), or because they are inconsistent with comparative evidence (if A did not cause B in other cases, then A likely did not cause B in this case either, even if A preceded B in time)."
Academics,"Stanford is in a position to emerge as the leading institution in the world for the study of Big History because it has an unusually large, and highly distinguished, group of Big History scholars. Those scholars are, however, spread across a broad range of departments, schools, and organized research units—including Classics, Economics, the Graduate School of Business (GSB) Finance, History, GSB Political Economy, Political Science, the Hoover institution, the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies (FSI), and the Law School."
Academics,"The goal of the Social Science History Program is to re-engineer the manner in which students in social science departments learn about historical institutions and data, and the manner in which students in history and related disciplines are trained in social science methods. Historians and social scientists share many of the same substantive interests, such as the development of economies, political systems, and social structures, but they approach them with different and complementary methods and bodies of evidence. There is a great deal of potential for historians and social scientists to draw from the strengths of each other's methods to improve their own work and to foster increased interaction among the disciplines that employ history as a laboratory to operationalize social science theories. The Social Science History Program seeks to realize this potential by transplanting state-of-the-art research methods from classics, economics, history, political science, and sociology across the boundaries of each discipline. Toward this end, SSHP offers conferences and research support for faculty and graduate students. The program is an affiliate of the Institute for Research in the Social Sciences."
Academics,"The program in History/Social Science Education is concerned with how young people make sense of both the past and their present in school and out-of-school settings. The program explores core issues of teaching and learning and, most broadly, engages the very nature of historical consciousness: What does it mean to live in a present suffused by the past? How can the skills of historical reasoning be leveraged to help us understand digital information that confronts us in the present? Over the past several years, our focus has increasingly been on what we call “Online Civic Reasoning,” and how to help students and teachers prepare for a world in which the very idea of truth is under assault."
Academics,"The power in the SHIPS approach to doctoral study is the way it opens up the possibilities for educational research by combining two distinctive approaches. One is to develop expertise in a disciplinary tradition. In this vein we offer seven programs in Humanities and Social Sciences in education (HSS): anthropology; economics; history; linguistics; organizational studies; philosophy; and sociology. The other approach is to develop expertise in a major issue area in education. In this vein, we offer four programs in Issue Domains in Education (IDE): educational policy; higher education; international comparative education (ICE); and education data science (EDS)."
Academics,"The PhD candidate in Anthropology of Education will take courses in the Department of Anthropology in addition to educational anthropology courses offered in the Graduate School of Education, for a combined total of at least 45 units. The course units in anthropology should include work in methodology, theory and its history, sociocultural and psychocultural processes, and ethnography. At least 20 units must be at the advanced graduate level. The 45 units of anthropology can be recognized as a PhD minor in anthropology or as a master's in the Anthropology Department."
Academics,"The program in Economics of Education aims to instill a thorough understanding of micro- and macro-economic analyses as they apply to the economics of education, a facility for using econometric modeling techniques to formulate complex relationships in education and to test such models with relevant data, and an acquaintance with the other social sciences as they relate to the economics of education."
Academics,"The program in Education Data Science serves students looking to employ modern data science analyses and computational methods to solve the world’s greatest educational challenges. It offers training in data science skills anchored in educational data, applications, and concerns. Analytically, students are expected to become familiar with statistics, programming languages, computational methods (machine learning, data mining), data visualization, and specialized analytic concerns, such as relational and textual data (network science and text analysis). These skill sets enable students to perform state-of-the-art analyses salient to digital data found in most educational, organizational and web-based companies."
Academics,"Students will take coursework focused on key data science principles, topics, and applications common to the use of data science in education contexts to ensure that they attain a common cohesive base of knowledge and skills with which to pursue academic areas of interest and specialization tracks later in their course plan. Students will also complete data science specializations in their course of study. The areas of specialization are Natural Language Processing, Network Science, Experiments & Causal Methods, Measurement, and Learning Analytics."
Academics,"The program in International Comparative Education (ICE) is a multidisciplinary, international, cross-cultural program of training that places educational problems into an international and comparative framework. Core courses explore how education is related to economic, political, and social development in both developed and developing countries. The program provides a strong theoretical and empirical base for studying education in a rapidly changing global context and for understanding the how and why of successful policy-making to improve educational practice in different social settings."
Academics,"The program in Educational Linguistics is interdisciplinary and draws substantially upon courses, faculty, and programs in various areas throughout Stanford GSE as well as departments within the School of Humanities and Sciences. Building upon a common core of linguistic foundations, graduates of the program in educational linguistics integrate theory, research, policy, and practices that are central to studies of language development and usage in schools and their surrounding communities."

Academics,"We hypothesize that lymph node metastasis constitutes an essential, first step in the metastatic cascade of cancer progression. Based on our preliminary findings, we speculate that such metastases act locally upon the adaptive immune system within the nodes to begin to induce systemic tolerance of the tumor. We will explore, compare and test this hypothesis in two malignancies: (i) melanoma and (ii) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team whose coordinated efforts will involve the application of genomic and single-cell in-situ imaging technologies on preclinical and human samples to explore the evidence and mechanisms of the induction of immunosuppression in the lymph nodes. We propose three inter-connected Research Projects that focus our scientific theme on different platforms: murine models (Project 1), high-dimensional in-situ imaging (Project 2), and integrative computational analysis (Project 3). All three projects will utilize a shared resource core dedicated to the acquisition of patient samples and associated clinical annotation and data management (Biospecimen and Data Management Core. These efforts will yield highly multiplexed, multi-scale datasets which will be analyzed by novel bio-computational methods to reconstruct intracellular and intercellular molecular interaction networks in order to identify, then functionally validate, critical mediators of tumor immunosuppression."

Campus,"Most of the University's other, more recent buildings echo the Quad's basic pattern of buff-colored walls, red roofs, and arcades, giving Stanford's campus its distinctive look.
The original university plan was to add additional quadrangles of buildings, initially to the left and right of the Main Quad. However, this part of the plan was put aside for many decades until the Science and Engineering Quad was built to the west, starting in the 1980s and completed in 2013. [32]"
Campus,"The Main Quad now houses many departments and classrooms and also the offices of the President, Provost, and administrative offices of the School of Humanities and Sciences. The main courtyard is used for University functions, in particular the Baccalaureate service held on the day before the main graduation ceremony, departmental graduation ceremonies, and the annual alumni reunion dinner.

Campus,"Our 35-acre campus is home to approximately 2,700 Stanford staff members. The campus was designed to reflect Stanford’s spirit, mission and culture of discovery, learning and contributing to a better world."
History,"Stanford University was founded in 1885 by California senator Leland Stanford and his wife, Jane, “to promote the public welfare by exercising an influence in behalf of humanity and civilization.”"
History,"When railroad magnate and former California Gov. Leland Stanford and his wife, Jane Lathrop Stanford, lost their only child, Leland, Jr., to typhoid in 1884, they decided to build a university as the most fitting memorial, and deeded to it a large fortune that included the 8,180-acre Palo Alto stock farm that became the campus. The campus is located within the traditional territory of the Muwekma Ohlone Tribe. The Stanfords made their plans just as the modern research university was taking form."
History,"University benefactor and trustee Herbert Hoover, future U.S. president and member of Stanford’s Pioneer Class of 1895, professionalized university operations in the 1920s and helped to put Stanford on a sound financial footing. He founded an institute to collect global political material – today’s
Hoover Institution
Library and Archives – and led the creation of the
Graduate School of Business
, both now world leaders in their respective fields."
History,"Engineering Professor Frederick Terman, dubbed the “Father of Silicon Valley,” left his stamp by encouraging Stanford students not only to develop but also to commercialize their ideas. In 1937, physicists Russell Varian, Sigurd Varian and William Hansen developed the klystron ultra-high-frequency vacuum tube, paving the way for commercial air navigation, satellite communication and high-energy particle accelerators. In 1939, graduate students William Hewlett and David Packard developed the precision audio oscillator, first low-cost method of measuring audio frequencies, and spun it into the company now known as HP. In 1951, the university developed its Stanford Research Park to house firms led by such innovators. Varian Associates became the first tenants."
History,"The post-World War II era saw many research advances. In 1959, Stanford Medical School moved from San Francisco to the main Palo Alto campus. The 1950s also saw planning of today’s
SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory
, managed under license from the U.S. Department of Energy and opened in 1962. The first website in North America went online at SLAC 29 years later. Advances in particle physics developed at SLAC led to the Linac Coherent Light Source, whose ability to capture ultra-fast images of chemical changes at atomic scale has made it a global destination for pharmaceutical research. The Cold War also gave rise to “the Dish,” the radio telescope that is a familiar landmark in the foothills behind campus. The hill housing the Dish is a conservation area open to the public, and more than 2,000 people run or hike “Dish Hill” each day."
History,"In the 1970s, Stanford sought new ways to transform society and preserve the environment. It severed its links to classified defense research and forged new paths for service and stewardship. Stanford reduced its dependence on the automobile by adding campus housing and the free Marguerite shuttle, named after a 19th-century horse that pulled a jitney between campus and Palo Alto. The
Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve
was designated in 1973 to help preserve the green “lungs” of the Peninsula and access to the biological data compiled there that helped establish the field of population genetics."
History,"In 1985, the B. Gerald Cantor Rodin Sculpture Garden opened as the largest collection of Rodin bronzes outside Paris. It became the nexus for a world-class collection of 20th- and 21st-century sculpture, nearly all of it freely accessible to the public. Today, the museum and sculpture garden are part of a Stanford arts district that includes the
Bing Concert Hall
, the McMurtry Building for experiential arts learning and the acclaimed
Anderson Collection
of 20th-century American painting."
History,"The Leland Stanford Junior University
was
founded in 1885
by Jane and Leland Stanford in memory of their only child, Leland Jr., who died of typhoid fever at 15. After his 1884 death, the Stanfords determined that they would use their wealth to do something for other people’s children."
History,"The university officially opened on October 1, 1891 to 555 students. On the university's opening day, Founding President
David Starr Jordan
(1851–1931) said to Stanford's Pioneer Class: ""[Stanford] is hallowed by no traditions; it is hampered by none. Its finger posts all point forward.""
However, much preceded the opening and continued for several years until the death of the last founder, Jane Stanford, in 1905 and the destruction by the 1906 earthquake.

History,"Stanford was founded by
Leland Stanford
, a railroad magnate,
U.S. senator
, and former
California governor
, together with his wife,
Jane Lathrop Stanford
. It is named in honor of their only child,
Leland Stanford Jr.
, who died in 1884 from typhoid fever just before his 16th birthday. His parents decided to dedicate a university to their only son, and Leland Stanford told his wife, ""The children of California shall be our children.""
The Stanfords visited [2]"
History,"Despite the duty to have a co-educational institution, in 1899, Jane Stanford, the remaining Founder, added to the Founding Grant the legal requirement that ""the number of women attending the University as students shall at no time ever exceed five hundred"". She feared the large numbers of women entering would lead the school to become ""the
Vassar
of the West"" and felt that would not be an appropriate memorial for her son. In 1933, the requirement was reinterpreted by the trustees to specify an undergraduate male:female ratio of 3:1.
The ""Stanford ratio"" of 3:1 remained in place until the early 1960s. By the late 1960s the ""ratio"" was about 2:1 for undergraduates, but much more skewed at the graduate level, except in the humanities. In 1973 the university trustees successfully petitioned the courts to have the restriction formally removed. As of 2014 the undergraduate enrollment is split nearly evenly between the sexes (47.2% women, 52.8% men), though males outnumber females (38.2% women, 61.8% men) at the graduate level. [7]"
History,"In the summer of 1886, when the campus was first being planned, Stanford brought the president of
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
,
Francis Amasa Walker

Some of the early construction, especially from the second phase between Leland Stanford's death in 1893 and Jane Stanford's death in 1905, was destroyed by the earthquake. The university retains the Quad, part of the

History,"The university started actively recruiting minorities in the 1960s. The minorities started organizing and ""in five years, students founded the six major community organizations: the Black Student Union (BSU) in 1967, the Asian American Students’ Association (AASA) and the Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan (MEChA) in 1969, the Stanford American Indian Organization (SAIO) in 1970, the Gay People's Union in 1971 and the Women's Collective in 1972.""

History,"Founded in 1831 by a farsighted group of prominent New Yorkers, the “University of the City of New-York” (as NYU was originally known) was envisioned from the start as something new: an academic institution metropolitan in character, democratic in spirit, and responsive to the demands of a bustling commercial culture."
History,"The group of founders—which included former Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin—envisioned a non-denominational institution that would be “a social investment and a direct response to the needs of the rising mercantile classes in New York,” intended both for those students “who devote themselves to scientific or literary pursuits,” and for those preparing for “the learned professions, commerce, or the mechanical and useful arts.”"
History,"In October 1832, the first classes began in rented quarters located downtown near City Hall, in contemporary subjects such as architecture, civil engineering, astronomy, chemistry, sculpture, painting, English and modern languages, as well as classical Greek and Latin."
History,"After a search for a permanent home, the University Council purchased the northeast block of Washington Square East for $40,000, and a handsome Gothic building was built there in 1835. The University Building, as it was known, offered an urbane mix of academic spaces on its lower floors and rental apartments above—rooms and studios whose extraordinary roster of tenants included the artist Winslow Homer, the inventors Samuel F.B. Morse and Samuel Colt (who perfected the electric telegraph and revolver there, respectively), and the architects A.J. Davis and Richard Morris Hunt."
History,"Throughout the 19th century, the University suffered from financial problems and an undergraduate enrollment that never exceeded 150 students. However, though the undergraduate program struggled to fulfill the vision of its founders, NYU’s professional and graduate programs—in law (1835), medicine (1841), dentistry (1865), arts and sciences (1886), and education (1890)—were a success from the start, contributing to New York’s stunning commercial rise and serving as an engine of upward mobility for thousands of native-born and immigrant New Yorkers."
History,"In the late 19th century, under the leadership of Chancellor Henry Mitchell MacCracken, the university advanced significantly, drawing together its far-flung schools under central control and attracting a more business-like Board of Trustees and donors. In what he called a “second founding,” MacCracken moved the undergraduate schools of arts and science and engineering to an entirely new campus in the Bronx, on a bluff overlooking Manhattan—a stunning second home for what was now known by a new name: New York University."
History,"Then, in 1914, NYU made the decision to establish an additional undergraduate program downtown that would serve commuter students. Called Washington Square College, it offered an education to nearly all qualified students, regardless of background. With students who were “famished…for knowledge, any kind of knowledge,” and a young and creative faculty, Washington Square College was, in one professor’s later words, “the most exciting venture in American education that I had ever heard of.”"
History,"As enrollments exploded—from 500 students in 1919 to more than 7,000 by 1929—NYU scrambled to hire instructors. Among them was a young writer named Thomas Wolfe, who, while working on his first novel,
Look Homeward, Angel
, taught English from 1924 to 1930. There is “no other way in which a man coming to this terrific city,” he wrote, “could have had a more…stimulating introduction to its swarming life, than through the corridors and classrooms of Washington Square.”"
History,"The postwar decades were a period of continued growth for NYU, as returning GIs swelled the student body even further; schools of social work (1960), the arts (1965), and individualized study (1972) were added; and plans were made under the leadership of President James Hester to construct the University’s first central library."
History,"By 1973, however, as New York City reeled from years of rising crime and financial troubles and enrollments declined, NYU—which had been running annual deficits since 1964—reluctantly sold its Bronx campus in order to regain solvency."
History,"These difficulties had one very positive result: they provided the opportunity to make a sweeping assessment of NYU’s future. The University had been founded on the two ideals of democratic promise and academic excellence. Since the 1920s, NYU had been fulfilling its democratic promise as no other private university in America; now, emerging from the crises of the '70s, it daringly sought to fulfill its founders’ other dream—to transform itself from a respected metropolitan institution to a global seat of learning, in the top tier of world universities."
History,"Throughout the 1970s, NYU gradually regained firm financial footing and began to improve the quality of its faculty, strengthen the curriculum, and establish more stringent admissions requirements. By the early 1980s, with the University’s financial health restored and New York itself emerging at last from decades of social and economic troubles, NYU was poised for a new era of growth."
History,"In 1984, seeking to achieve what its recently appointed president, John Brademas, called “a new position of eminence in American higher education,” NYU undertook one of the first billion-dollar capital campaigns in academic history. Raising two million dollars a week for five hundred weeks, the University reached its goal in only ten years—five years ahead of schedule. President Brademas’s tenure also saw the transformation of Washington Square from a largely commuter campus into a residential one, with extensive construction and renovation of residence halls."
History,"In 1991, NYU’s chancellor, L. Jay Oliva, was tapped as the University’s new president. Under President Oliva—a historian who had spent his entire academic career at NYU—the pace of advancement continued without stop. One of his primary goals was to ensure that the fast-rising stature of the professional schools and arts divisions were matched by an equivalent commitment to the humanities and social science departments—many of which are now ranked among the best in the world."
History,"In 1831, Albert Gallatin, the distinguished statesman who served as secretary of the treasury under Presidents Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, led NYU's founding council. He would later describe his vision for the institution in a letter to a friend:"
History,"At that time, most students in American colleges and universities were members of the privileged classes. Gallatin and the founding council believed that an educated general populace was crucial to the preservation of democratic institutions. They envisioned a new kind of university: non-denominational and open to all, regardless of national origin, religious beliefs, or social background; with a varied, modern curriculum appropriate for both students ""who devote themselves to scientific or literary pursuits,"" and those preparing for ""the learned professions, commerce, or the mechanical and useful arts."""
History,"NYU’s graduate programs were highly successful in the 19th century, contributing to New York’s stunning commercial rise and serving as an engine of upward mobility for thousands of native-born and immigrant New Yorkers."
History,"The Institute of Fine Arts is founded. In 1958, it relocated to a historic mansion on the Upper East Side, in the heart of New York’s “Museum Mile.”"
History,"Also in 1934, the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences is founded. Faculty members from the Institute would go on to win the Abel Prize four times in ten years—more than any other institution."
History,"As male enrollment dropped during WWII, NYU filled its classrooms with a large number of women, who made up over 50 percent of enrolled students at NYU from 1943 to 1945. In February 1943, the Chance Vought Division of United Aircraft established a scholarship to bring women who had majored in mathematics and physics at the nation's leading colleges to train at NYU's Guggenheim School of Aeronautical Engineering."
History,"The
history of New York University
begins in the early 19th century. A group of prominent
New York City
residents from the city's landed class of merchants, bankers, and traders established
NYU
on April 18, 1831. These New Yorkers believed the city needed a university designed for young men who would be admitted based on merit, not birthright or social class.
Albert Gallatin

Secretary of the Treasury

and

For the school's founders, the classical curriculum offered at American colonial colleges needed to be combined with a more modern and practical education. Educators in [1]"
History,"A three-day-long ""literary and scientific convention"" held in
City Hall
in 1830 and attended by over 100 delegates debated the terms of a plan for a university modeled on the
University of London
, which had been founded in 1826. The trustees of the new institution sought funding from the city and state, but were turned down, and instead raised $100,000 privately to start up the college.
The school would make available education to all qualified young men at a reasonable cost, would abandon the exclusive use of ""classical"" curriculum, and would be financed privately through the sale of stock. Establishing a joint stock company was aimed to prevent any religious group or denomination from dominating the affairs and management of the new institution. Although the university was designed to be open to all men regardless of background, NYU's early classes were composed almost entirely of the sons of wealthy, white, [2]"
History,"On April 21, 1831, the new institution received its
charter
and was incorporated as the University of the City of New York by the New York State Legislature; older documents often refer to it by that name. In 1832, NYU held its first classes in rented rooms in four-story Clinton Hall, situated near
City Hall
. In 1835, the
School of Law
, NYU's first professional school, was established. The university has been popularly known as New York University since its beginning. The school was officially renamed New York University in 1896."
History,"Clinton Hall, situated in New York's bustling and noisy commercial district, would only be NYU's home for a few years, as administrators searched uptown for a more suitable and permanent academic environment. For example, the administrators looked towards bucolic Greenwich Village. Land was purchased on the east side of
Washington Square
and, in 1833, construction began on the ""Old University Building,"" a grand, Gothic structure that would house all the school's functions. Two years later, the university community took possession of its permanent home, thus beginning NYU's enduring (and sometimes tumultuous) relationship with the Village."
History,"Whereas NYU had its
Washington Square
campus since its beginning, the university purchased a campus at
University Heights
in
the Bronx
because of overcrowding on the old campus and the desire to follow New York City's development further uptown. NYU's move to the Bronx occurred in 1894, spearheaded by the efforts of Chancellor
Henry Mitchell MacCracken
. The University Heights campus was far more spacious than its predecessor was, and housed most of the university's operations and the undergraduate
NYU College of Arts and Science
and School of Engineering. The graduate schools of NYU remained at Washington Square when the undergraduate college and the school of engineering moved to the University Heights campus.
[3]"
History,"In 1914, NYU founded Washington Square College as an undergraduate liberal arts college on the Washington Square campus. This college would become the downtown Arts and Sciences division of NYU. In 1900, NYU founded its undergraduate School of Commerce, Accounts, and Finance, which ultimately became the Leonard N. Stern School of Business, providing professional training in business for young people. The idea of a
Long Island
campus came about as a result of Truesdel Peck Calkins, former Hempstead superintendent of schools who was then with New York University, who suggested an NYU extension course on the estate of Dutch entrepreneur William S. Hofstra.
In 1935, NYU opened the ""Nassau College-Hofstra Memorial of New York University at Hempstead, Long Island"". This extension would later become a fully independent [4]"
History,"NYU offered women access to graduate studies in 1888, teaching and law in 1890, and undergraduate studies at Washington Square College (then a satellite campus). Important academic discussions took place at NYU around this time, as the
American Chemical Society
was founded here on April 6, 1876. When women were first admitted to the University Heights College (which would later become the College of Arts and Science) in 1959, many alumni and male undergraduates were unhappy. The student newspaper remarked on the instituting of coeducation by applying part of a quote from Lord Chesterfield on the subject of sex, “the position undignified, the pleasure momentary, and the consequences damnable”.
One early attempt to increase the egalitarian nature of the university failed: In 1871, an attempt to offer free tuition to students who were academically qualified backfired. The wealthy, Protestant alumni viewed a free university as a charity institution inappropriate for their own children to attend; thus, the attempt of implementing free tuition was abandoned."
History,"Beginning in the 1920s, NYU attracted the most talented Jewish students, as they were turned away from Ivy League institutions due to “Jewish quotas” that especially targeted first generation Jewish (and other) immigrants living in New York City for exclusion. Despite NYU's experimentation with these quotas, a good portion of its students was Jewish during this period."
History,"During the 1920s NYU decided to grow by offering admission to almost all applicants. By 1929 it became the largest urban university in the United States with more than 40,000 students. Due in part to the
G.I. Bill
, enrollment after World War II was greater than 70,000. Most students failed to graduate, however, as they were unable to meet the university's academic standards. The university began a large construction campaign that continued until the early 1970s. In 1962 new president
James McNaughton Hester
decided to improve NYU's reputation by raising admissions standards, widening student recruiting, and hiring new faculty. The size of the freshman class declined by about one third, but average grades and test scores rose. Most of the new spending occurred on the Washington Square campus, however, causing tensions between it and University Heights. The smaller student body also caused the new buildings to be underused, and forced the university to directly spend donated money on operating costs. Enrollment declined to under 40,000 in 1972 compared to 45,000 a few years earlier.
[3]"
History,"In the late 1960s and early 1970s, financial crisis gripped the New York City government and many of the city's institutions, including NYU. The university became concerned about
urban decay
in the Bronx during the mid-1960s, but feared publicizing the issue. A 1969 city government study stated that the neighborhood was still healthy, but expressed concern over the future. Several prominent newspaper articles during the decade that discussed the economic and social decline of the nearby
Grand Concourse
, however, contributed to widespread panic among both residents and the families of potential students. Enrollment on the University Heights campus rapidly declined; between 1969 and 1971, it lost more than 40% of its students, and the campus accounted for more than 40% of the university's budget deficit. Feeling the pressures of imminent bankruptcy, NYU sold the
University Heights campus
to the
City University of New York
(CUNY), which occurred in 1973 (it now serves as the
Bronx Community College
campus). NYU's School of Engineering and Science, its students, faculty, and programs, were merged into the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn to form the Polytechnic Institute of New York.
The [6]"
History,"Although University Heights alumni battled to keep the campus, many people suggest the sale was a ""blessing in disguise"" because the uptown campus was losing money; NYU managing two campuses was impracticable. Chancellor Sidney Borowitz said on the matter, ""There was so much pressure from uptown alumni to preserve the Heights that it was only under the threat of possible financial ruin the campus could be sold. With two campuses, NYU could never have prospered as it has."" After the sale of the University Heights campus, University College merged with Washington Square College. NYU's most significant loss from this challenging period was the School of Engineering that officially merged with
Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn
to form the Polytechnic Institute of New York, later to be called Polytechnic University.
[7]"
History,"Beginning in the mid-1980s, NYU became increasingly popular to students from outside New York City. To meet the demand for housing and classroom space, the university began purchasing old office buildings, hotels, and even nightclubs, becoming one of the largest landholders in New York City
In the 1980s, under the leadership of President [8]"
History,"In the summer of 2008, Polytechnic University in Brooklyn, the second oldest engineering school in the nation, affiliated with NYU giving the university an engineering school for the first time since 1973, when NYU's School of Engineering and Science, its students, faculty, and programs, were merged into the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn to form the Polytechnic Institute of New York (which later became Polytechnic University).
On January 1, 2014 it fully merged with NYU and was named the NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering. [12]"
History,"In 1932, NYU's graduate program in art history moved to the Upper East Side in order to teach in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Under the energetic leadership of its chairman, Walter S. Cook, the program effectively leveraged the cultural and financial resources of New York to become one of the world's most distinguished centers for art historical research and education, renamed the Institute of Fine Arts in 1937. The Institute was strengthened greatly by refugee professors from the German and Austrian institutions that had given birth to the modern discipline of art history. Foundational art historians such as Erwin Panofsky, Walter Friedlaender, Karl Lehmann, Julius Held, and Richard Krautheimer set the Institute on the course of rigorous, creative, and pluralistic scholarship and strong worldwide connections it continues to pursue today. In 1973, the National Endowment for the Humanities commended the Institute as a national asset for its leadership role in art historical scholarship and training. The Endowment is one of numerous institutional and private benefactors that continue to support the Institute's work."

Student Life,"Every year, roughly 6,500 NYU students compete against one another in more than
20 intramural leagues and events
. Intramural athletics range from soccer, basketball, and badminton to e-gaming, box cricket, and bowling. While competitions and games are commonly held once a week, some sports play more often. There could be practices as well. But most intramural teams require a commitment of just a few hours a week."
Student Life,"Recreation classes, which are held across NYU’s fitness facilities—the
Palladium Athletic Facility
,
404 Fitness
, and the
Brooklyn Athletic Facility
—include various types of dance, swimming, and yoga as well as weightlifting, spin, and Zumba. Many classes are offered both in person and virtually, and they couldn’t be easier to attend. Just
check the schedule
and show up or log on at the appropriate time."
Student Life,"Club sports
at NYU take athletics up one more notch, with students competing at the intercollegiate level against teams from other colleges and universities. The more than two dozen club options, including figure skating, lacrosse, and ultimate Frisbee, often require a bit more of a commitment than intramurals and recreation classes do. Club teams frequently practice with coaches and instructors a few times a week. Weekends are reserved for competitions, either at home or on away trips to other schools."
Student Life,"“I absolutely fell in love,” says Madi Richardson, a junior who serves as an instructor for Intra-Fit. As an intramural league, Intra-Fit teaches participants good workout habits and techniques through weightlifting, cardio, plyometrics, and more. She shares that she felt intimidated by the gym during her first year at NYU but wanted to stay in shape following foot surgery. “Intra-Fit was instrumental in helping me, especially as a woman, find my place in the gym,” Madi asserts. “I love how everyone brings a great vibe and is so supportive.”"
Student Life,"And Roban agrees. It’s no secret that athletics offer physical, mental, and emotional benefits. But he feels the community-based benefits are athletics’ largest boon at NYU. “Whether you do it through rec classes, intramurals, or club sports, it’s about finding your fit by asking yourself how you want to de-stress and what community you want to be part of,” he says. “We provide so many options for everyone to explore what they want to do and just get moving.”"
Student Life,"Student clubs promote professional development in a broad range of industries and interests – from finance and accounting, to social impact, to entertainment. Many of the clubs focus on career development and cultivate strong relationships with companies, organizations, and NYU Stern alumni. The student-led Inter-Club Council oversees NYU Stern's club system."
Student Life,"NYU Stern Student Council, the official student governing body, strives to strengthen the NYU and Stern community and provide an open forum for all NYU Stern students. Student Council also provides a wide array of social programming that brings the community together, hosting events such as Casino Night, Class Wars, Fall Harvest, the Stern Talent Show, Semi-Formal, and more."
Student Life,"NYU's club system is comprised of more than 400 student-led clubs – from Chess Club to Cheese Club and so many more. In addition to the clubs you can get involved in at NYU Stern, there are many more ways to discover a new community, hobby, or passion by joining an NYU Club. At the start of every semester, NYU hosts Club Fest, where you can explore clubs, join their mailing lists, and start getting involved."
Student Life,"There are more than
300
all-square clubs
at NYU, in addition to club sports, student-led media, and programs designed to help you build a close-knit community on campus and beyond.

The NYU Shanghai Residence Halls strive to create a community that enables students to live independently and transition smoothly into a new environment away from home.
Student Life,"Living on campus fosters overall academic success and a sense of belonging. By living on campus, students develop a variety of life skills, character, values, and maturity. Residential students are more involved on campus and take advantage of campus resources. In addition, by living on campus, students meet peers from diverse backgrounds, are exposed to a wide range of ideas, cultures, and learn cross-cultural communication skills. Living on campus supports holistic student development and links academic learning with co-curricular learning."
Student Life,"Fraternity and Sorority Life at NYU encourages leadership, fosters quality of scholarship, cultivates friendships, provides opportunities for civic engagement, and upholds our University’s ideals of perseverance and excellence in a space that fosters diversity and inclusion. NYU's Office of Fraternity and Sorority Life is part of the Center for Student Life."
Student Life,"Greek life?? At NYU?? I know, unexpected. However, NYU actually has a vibrant Greek life with seven outstanding sororities: Alpha Epsilon Phi (AEPhi), Alpha Sigma Tau (AST), Delta Gamma (DG), Delta Phi Epsilon (DPhiE), Kappa Kappa Gamma (KKG), Pi Beta Phi (PiPhi), and Zeta Tau Alpha (ZTA). They are all part of the National Panhellenic Council (NPC). Each one is a unique organization that works to foster service, leadership, and sisterhood. Joining a sorority can give you a support system and solid group of friends at one of the biggest colleges in the country."
Student Life,"The level of involvement you have in your sorority is up to you. Every sorority has an executive board that’s in charge of all major events and decisions. Every executive board member has staff members under them. You could be in charge of sisterhood, organizing activities for all of your sisters. Or you could be an NYDM team captain, where you help your sorority sisters raise money for the annual
New York Dance Marathon
."
Student Life,"As an international student, I learned about fraternities and sororities from traditional film and television. Which means I held the stereotypical idea of them. From that understanding alone, I deduced it was not an activity for me. But much like everything else at NYU, I learned that the organizations and their people are far from the stereotypical picture I painted in my head."
Student Life,"I started my sophomore year at NYU in the fall of 2020. By then, I was very involved in clubs and activities on campus, and I had a solid group of friends. But the COVID-19 pandemic put a strange freeze on all of that. I hadn’t seen some of my friends in months. And I missed the sense of community being on campus gave me. So in the thick of it, and after a push from a friend, I decided to rush."
Student Life,"Greek life has a long, complicated history. But I can proudly say the sororities at NYU represent amazing philanthropies, have flourishing sisterhoods, and support their members academically, professionally, and socially. Whether you’re a general member or a member of the leadership team, you get back whatever you put in. Plus, everyone is dedicated to uplifting and supporting each other. So Greek life can help make such a large and daunting place like NYU feel much smaller. What’s more, having a familiar face in my classes and people to say hi to as I head home as well as a vast alumni network to tap into are extra perks."
Student Life,"Going to NYU is an unconventional experience, and that’s due, in part, to our lack of a centralized campus. Your friends are most likely prior connections or people in your dorm, classes. Most people aren’t going to the same events. Sure, there are some typical restaurants or bars to mingle at, but for the most part, your network at NYU can feel limited. For some students, myself included, NYU life can feel more like living in an apartment in Greenwich Village and taking occasional day classes than actually going to a full-time college. We’re too spread out."
Student Life,"Some students chose NYU because they wanted something different from the traditional college experience. Many of us prefer a college experience that resembles the life of an adult living in the city. Despite that, there’s no reason that both realities can’t simultaneously exist. Students can choose to experience a precursor to adult life, while also being afforded the social opportunities characteristic of a traditional college."
Student Life,"Student Life is dedicated to promoting the personal growth and development of all students. Our goal is to empower students by providing opportunities for leadership and service to others. We also seek to expand and enrich the university experience by providing social, cultural, educational, and recreational programs. This site will offer you a glimpse of the services and events offered by our office. In addition, it will give you an overview of the Greek-lettered student organizations that exist at the College."

Cryptography or cryptology is the science of designing algorithms and protocols for enabling parties to communicate and compute securely in an untrusted environment (e.g. secure communication, digital signature, etc.) Over the last four decades, cryptography has transformed from an ad hoc collection of mysterious tricks into a rigorous science based on firm complexity-theoretic foundations. This modern complexity-theoretic approach to cryptography will be the focus. E.g., in the context of encryption we will begin by giving a precise mathematical definition for what it means to be a secure encryption scheme and then give a construction (realizing this security notion) assuming various computational hardness assumptions (e.g. factoring).

Campus,"Over the course of UC Berkeley’s long and tumultuous history, our campus has seen the construction of some of California’s most iconic and exemplary buildings — many of which still stand today."
Campus,"Whether you’re walking up Telegraph Avenue or lounging on Memorial Glade, inhabiting Berkeley means you’ll inevitably run into some work of historic, architectural genius. From the Campanile to the Valley Life Sciences Building, part of what makes campus’s architectural landscape so beautiful is the diversity of design and structure that characterizes its buildings. Here are some of UC Berkeley’s most renowned buildings — with some historical tidbits just for you!"
Campus,"Built in 1914 in honor of project donor Jane Krom Sather, the Campanile stands at a whopping 303 feet tall, according to Harvey Helfand, author of “University of California, Berkeley: An Architectural Tour.” The tower, a renowned UC Berkeley landmark, houses a 316-step staircase, the original “Sather Bells” — which were safely shipped from England amid World War I — and a belfry with arches measuring 22 feet high. The belfry in turn houses the carillon, a piano-esque instrument with 61 bells. Students can learn to play the Campanile’s carillon via a Decal offered each semester."
Campus,"Architect John Galen Howard, inspired by the Campanile di San Marco in Venice, built the tower at the center of campus. It was situated between South and North halls, the latter of which is no longer standing, Helfand’s book notes."
Campus,"South Hall is currently the oldest surviving building on campus. Construction began April 1870 and was completed November 1873, two months after architect David Farquharson’s North Hall was erected, according to Helfand. Though North Hall has since been demolished and replaced, South Hall — home to campus’s School of Information — still stands."
Campus,"The four-story brick building is characteristic of the French Second Empire style, as distinguished by its slate mansard roof, ornamental cast-iron cresting and projecting dormer windows. Despite their aesthetic beauty, the cast-iron pillars are not simply decorative but are also used to secure iron-reinforcing bars that mitigate earthquake risk. This style, which harkens back to the reign of Napoleon III, was immensely popular in the United States during the 1860s and ’70s, according to the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission."
Campus,"When Wheeler Hall was named in 1915, the decision was one that broke with tradition. Instead of honoring a nonliving figure, Wheeler Hall commemorated former campus president Benjamin Wheeler during his 16th year in office. The building, built in a neoclassical style, fulfilled campus’s need for additional classrooms and a large auditorium, according to Helfand. Ionic columns and the Greek god Apollo’s sculpted head decorate the building’s south-facing front facade."
Campus,"Berkeley is famous for the amount of wonderful structures it has listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Churches, old private houses, buildings of historical importance and other impressive edifices are all representative of Berkley’s architectural beauty. Take this self-guided walking tour to explore the most notable historical landmarks in Berkeley."
Campus,"Due to its location on the corner of Bowditch Street and Dwight Way, it is very easy for visitors to admire the building's architecture. From street level, tourists can see the hammered Belgian glass of the windows and the carved reliefs that top the exterior columns. They will also be able to pinpoint the Japanese influences that are apparent in the courtyard rooftops and the portal to the Sunday School wing."
Campus,"The building is five stories tall and built of masonry with a tiled mansard roof and rounded upper floor window bays. The first-floor bays, used as shop fronts, were originally built in the form of a series of alternating rounded and pointed arches, although some of these have since been covered. The building's name is set into the tile floor at the entrance, and derives from the fact that the top floor of the building was designed as artists’ studios."
Campus,"Berkeley is a colorful and joyful city that offers a great variety of places to shop. Telegraph Avenue is the best shopping area in the city, featuring Rasputin and Amoeba Music, the originality of Berkeley Hat, Bear Basics, Bancroft Clothing and many others.

Campus,"From 1938 to 1948, the San Francisco architect
Arthur Brown Jr.

Campus,"With his 1944 general plan, Brown broke the long east–west cross-campus axis that dated back to the earliest plans by Olmsted; he shortened it to terminate just before the northeast corner of campus, where he had planned library and mathematics buildings. In addition, he designated uses for the unused northwest (forestry, agriculture, and home economics) and southeast (jurisprudence, anthropology, and arts) corners.

The final version of the 1944 plan reduced open spaces on campus to a minimum, as maintaining the Beaux-Arts precedents using low, sprawling buildings in the constrained site was inadequate to handle the forecasted explosive growth in enrollment, and he resigned his post in 1948.

The [12]"
Campus,"Standing at the center of the university is the iconic
Geisel Library
, named after
Dr. Seuss
following a $20 million donation from his wife Audrey. Library Walk, a heavily traveled pathway leading from the library to Gilman Drive, lies adjacent or close to
Price Center
, Center Hall, International Center, and various student services buildings, including the Student Services Center and the Career Services building. The layout of the main campus centers on
Geisel Library
, which is roughly surrounded by the seven residential colleges of
Revelle
,
Muir
,
Marshall
,
Warren
,
Roosevelt
,
Sixth
,
Seventh
, and the
School of Medicine
. The seven colleges maintain separate housing facilities for their students and each college's buildings are differentiated by distinct architectural styles. As residential colleges were added while the university expanded, buildings in newer colleges were designed with styles that were starkly different from that of the original campus. The disparate architectural styles led
Travel + Leisure
, in its October 2013 issue, to name the university as one of the ugliest campuses in America, likening it to ""a cupboard full of kitchen appliances whose function you can't quite fathom.""
[54]"
Campus,"When the campus opened in 1964, it consisted only of
Revelle College
and
Scripps Institution of Oceanography
. The school's rapid increase in enrollment and opening to undergraduate students over its first decade spurred major campus expansion.
Muir

Marshall
, and
Warren
Colleges were established and built during the late 1960s through 1980s as the student population continued to grow considerably. Initially, the campus followed a rough north–south axis alongside
Historic Route 101
, though construction in the following decades deviated from this, with the core of the campus shifting towards Geisel Library.

History,"More than fifty years ago, the founders of the University of California San Diego had one criterion for the campus: it must be distinctive. Since then, UC San Diego has achieved the extraordinary in teaching, research, and public service."
History,"Founded in 1960, UC San Diego enrolled its first undergraduates in 1964. Nevertheless, the campus can trace its origins as far back as the late 1800s. At that time, zoologists at the UC Berkeley campus, seeking a suitable location for a marine field station, found the La Jolla area of San Diego a very desirable site. The facility they established became a part of the University of California in 1912 and was eventually named the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. In the late 1950s, when the regents of the University of California decided to situate a general campus in the region, Scripps Institution of Oceanography formed the nucleus of the new campus."
History,"When the
Regents of the University of California
originally authorized the San Diego campus in 1956, it was planned to be a graduate and research institution, providing instruction in the sciences, mathematics, and engineering.
Local citizens supported the idea, voting the same year to transfer to the university 59 acres (24 ha) of mesa land on the coast near the preexisting [28]"
History,"Over the span of six decades, what began as a brand new University of California campus situated on the coast of La Jolla has evolved into one of the top 20 research universities in the world. From its start in 1960, University of California, San Diego founder Roger Revelle envisioned the institution as one that would stand out definitively from the rest. Since then, the university has lived up to that criteria, making its mark on the world through a legacy of innovative collaboration and cutting-edge impact."
History,"UC San Diego was officially founded on November 18, 1960, as a forward-thinking experimental campus serving a few graduate students in physics, chemistry and earth sciences. Scripps Institution of Oceanography, established in the early 1900s and now a division of the university, catalyzed UC San Diego’s initial growth. By the time UC San Diego was founded, Scripps was already recognized as a prominent research institution with prestigious faculty such as Charles David Keeling, a geochemist whose discoveries became a touchstone in global climate change research and understanding."
History,"In the fall of 1964, UC San Diego welcomed its first trailblazing class of 181 undergraduates. Since then, the university’s population of bright and talented students have been steadily climbing. This summer, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the university safely and successfully celebrated over 9,000 students in its graduating class with UC San Diego’s first-ever Virtual Commencement."

Academics,"Media and Mass Communication
includes courses in digital media production for broadcast news and the entertainment media; professional and journalistic writing for online and other outlets; writing and video production for social media; documentaries & digital storytelling; sports media relations & sports broadcasting; media management; specialized communication such as travel writing; copy editing; role of mass media in society; and video games."
Academics,"Journalism is the practice of gathering, recording, verifying, and reporting on information of public importance. Though these general duties have been historically consistent, the particulars of the journalistic process have evolved as the ways information is collected, disseminated, and consumed have changed. Things like the invention of the printing press in the 15
th
century, the ratification of the First Amendment in 1791, the completion of the first transatlantic telegraph cable in 1858, the first televised presidential debates in 1960, and more have broadened the ways that journalists write (as well as the ways that their readers read). Today, journalists may perform a number of different roles. They still write traditional text-based pieces, but they may also film documentaries, record podcasts, create photo essays, help run 24-hour TV broadcasts, and keep the news at our fingertips via social media and the internet. Collectively, these various journalistic media help members of the public learn what is happening in the world so they may make informed decisions."
Academics,"The most important difference between journalism and other forms of non-fiction writing is the idea of objectivity. Journalists are expected to keep an objective mindset at all times as they interview sources, research events, and write and report their stories. Their stories should not aim to persuade their readers but instead to inform. That is not to say you will never find an opinion in a newspaper—rather, journalists must be incredibly mindful of keeping subjectivity to pieces like editorials, columns, and other opinion-based content."
Academics,"Similarly, journalists devote most of their efforts to working with primary sources, whereas a research paper or another non-fiction piece of writing might frequently consult an encyclopedia, a scholarly article, or another secondary or tertiary source. When a journalist is researching and writing their story, they will often interview a number of individuals—from politicians to the average citizen—to gain insight into what people have experienced, and the quotes journalists collect drive and shape their stories."
Academics,"With an online bachelor's degree in communication you'll have the opportunity to pursue a multitude of career options. From journalism and social media, to public relations, advertising and mass media, earning your BA in communication will allow you to strategize and communicate your ideas."

September 16, 1874, classes began with six instructors and sixty-four
students."
History,"The first Department of Computer Sciences in the United States was established at Purdue University in October 1962. There are three natural phases in its history. In the 1960s the effort was to define courses, degree programs, and indirectly the field itself. The 1970s saw the department's maturation and growth into a typical university department. The 1980s started with a series of crises, some nationwide and some internal to Purdue, which eventually gave the department a considerably different character than it had in the 1970s. Table 1 presents a chronology of the
principal events and milestones for 1962-1996
."
History,"The first task of Samuel Conte as new department head was to hire some faculty and define a graduate program. The course offerings planned were not large — enough graduate courses for the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees and an undergraduate service course in programming. In the very first year, there were five teaching faculty, Samuel Conte, Richard Kenyon, L. Duane Pyle, Robert Korfhage, and Saul Rosen. Although not all of the faculty taught full time, they could offer over 20 courses a year, which was ample to support the planned program. In 1963 there were three new faculty members: Richard Buchi, Walter Gautschi, and John Steele. The following year John Rice was hired."
History,"The new Mathematical Sciences building was completed in 1967, and the department (along with statistics) moved there from the Engineering Administration building. The Computer Sciences Center occupied the two floors below ground. The department occupied the fourth floor, which was substantially larger than the previous space and also much nicer."
History,"By the beginning of the 1970s, the department had completed its pioneering years: Degree programs were established; there was a faculty of 15 and dozens of computer science departments at other universities; and Purdue's department was fully independent. The 1970s were to be a decade of consolidation and maturation. But there were still serious challenges; perhaps the most difficult was hiring faculty. Throughout the 1970s almost every computer science department had unfilled positions for computer science Ph.D.s, as did many major industries."
History,"The number of entering freshmen majoring in computer science during the 1970s did grow some: About 80-100 entered from 1970-1974. Enrollment then increased to 150 a year from 1975-1977. In 1978 and 1979 the number increased to 200, then 300, and the crisis was on us (see
Figure 1
). This growth was nationwide. For one year in the early 1980s, a survey showed that 9% of the high school graduates wanted to study computer science. If this percentage had continued, computer science would have had as many students as all of engineering! By the fall of 1981 there were over 500 freshmen starting out in computer science. Earlier groups of students were advancing through the curriculum, and the undergraduate courses overflowed, new sections were added and then they overflowed again."

Academics,"The field of Behavioral Economics (BE) integrates perspectives from Economics and Psychology to better understand how people make consequential decisions and to leverage this understanding to improve the design of the policies, programs, and institutions that govern such behavior. The last decade has witnessed an explosion of interest in BE among governments and organizations, around the world, including here in the United States. On the policy front, this has led to the formation of government “nudge” units charged with applying BE principles to policy areas such as education, criminal justice, taxation, social benefit programs, consumer protection, and unemployment. Organizations have also aggressively sought to apply BE to encourage employee productivity, improve employee health and financial wellness, reshape managerial and hiring decisions, and to better understand and engage consumers."
Academics,"This is presented as a recommended plan for completing major requirements. The major can be completed in as few as two years (not that it must be), but students may not have time for other opportunities such as additional majors or study abroad. Students may declare their major as early as the third week of the spring semester in the freshman year. Students who are planning to attend the Washington Semester Program, to study abroad, to apply for the Heinz Accelerated Masters Program, or to pursue an additional major/minor may have a very different curriculum map and should consult early – and often – with the Behavioral Economics, Policy and Organizations Academic Advisor."
Academics,"The interdisciplinary field of Decision Science seeks to understand and improve the judgment and decision making of individuals, groups, and organizations. Qualified graduates can continue to PhD programs in Decision Science or related fields (e.g., psychology, business), pursue professional degrees (e.g., MBA, MD, JD, MPH), or take professional positions in business, government, consulting, or the non-profit sector. Students work with faculty and the Academic Advisor to tailor their education to their personal needs and interest."
Academics,"Carnegie Mellon is one of the leading centers for the study of Decision Science - and offers the only undergraduate major that integrates analytical and behavioral approaches to decision making.

Academics,"Decision Science is grounded in theories and methods drawn from psychology, economics, philosophy, statistics, and management science. Courses in the major cover the three aspects of decision science: (a) normative analysis, creating formal models of choice; (b) descriptive research, studying how cognitive, emotional, social, and institutional factors affect judgment and choice, and (c) prescriptive interventions, seeking to improve judgment and decision making. In addition to gaining a broad education in the principles of judgment and decision making, Decision Science majors gain broadly applicable skills in research design and analysis to behavioral problems in consumer, organizational, and public policy arenas.. application of research findings"
Academics,"The core courses present fundamental theories and results from the study of decision making, along with their application to real-world problems. They introduce students to methods for collecting and analyzing behavioral data. For example, students learn to conduct surveys (e.g., uncovering consumer or managerial preferences), design experiments (e.g., evaluating theories, comparing ways of presenting information), and evaluate the effectiveness of interventions."
Academics,"The elective courses provide students with additional knowledge in areas of decision making that meet their personal, intellectual, and career goals. These courses are organized into six clusters: biological and behavioral aspects of decision making, managerial and organizational aspects, philosophical and ethical perspectives, economic and statistical methods, public policy, and research methods. Students can concentrate in one area or spread their studies across them. In addition to coursework, the department offers research opportunities for interested and qualified students. Participating in research helps students to extend their mastery of decision science, discover whether a research career is right for them, and get to know faculty and graduate students better."

Academics,All candidates for the bachelor's degree in Computer Science must complete a minimum of 36 units offered by the Mellon College of Science and/or the College of Engineering (CIT). These courses offer students an opportunity to explore scientific and engineering domains that can influence their effectiveness as computer scientists upon graduation.
Academics,"In general, courses taken in satisfaction of the minor or additional major may also count toward any general education category in the CS major (i.e. courses outside of the Computer Science and Mathematics requirements). Double counting toward Computer Science and Mathematics courses in the CS major is strictly limited and depends on the chosen minor (or additional major). In general, students may double count at most 5 of the 12 core Computer Science requirements toward all other declared additional majors and minors. Additional majors and minors have their own double counting rules as well. Consult with a CS undergraduate advisor and an advisor from the department of the minor (or additional major) for specific restrictions on double counting."
Academics,"CS majors may use the SCS Honors Research Thesis as part of their degree. The SCS Honors Undergraduate Research Thesis (
07-599
) typically starts in the fall semester of the senior year, and spans the entire senior year. Students receive a total of 36 units of academic credit for the thesis work, 18 units per semester. Up to 18 units can be counted toward CS elective requirements (9 per semester for 2 semesters maximum). Students interested in research may also consider using Research and Innovation in Computer Science (
07-300
, 9 units) as their technical communications requirement in their junior year since this course will introduce students to various research projects going on in the School of Computer Science that may lead to a senior thesis. This course leads to a subsequent Research Practicum in Computer Science (
07-400
, 12 units) that allows students to complete a small-scale research study or experiment and present a research poster. Students who use 15-400 to start their senior thesis can use these units toward the required 36 units."
Academics,"Students pursuing a Dual Degree in Computer Science must complete all requirements for the CS primary major (except
15-128
which is not required and
15-151
which will be replaced with
21-127
or
21-128
). In addition, at most 5 of the 12 computer science requirements can double count with all other declared majors and minors. Students, especially from interdisciplinary majors or with multiple majors or minors, are urged to consult with the Assistant Dean or Undergraduate Program Coordinator in the CS Undergraduate Office to determine double-counting restrictions specific to their own situations."
Academics,"Students interested in pursuing an additional major in Computer Science should first consult with the Program Coordinator in the CS Undergraduate Office. Students are expected to complete the requirements for the CS minor first before continuing on to the additional major. Completion of the CS additional major requires 12 computer science courses (not including
15-110
and
15-112
if needed), 5 mathematics courses, and 1 technical communication course. Students are expected to complete all courses for the additional major with an average QPA of 3.0 or higher."
Academics,"Declaration for the additional major is allowed only after all math requirements are completed or in progress, and at least 9 of the 12 CS requirements (core and electives) are completed or in progress. Due to high demand, seats in upper-level CS courses are not guaranteed for additional majors so students should plan to be flexible in selecting constrained and general electives. Acceptance to complete a Computer Science additional major is not guaranteed and depends on student performance and seat availability."
Academics,"Students pursuing an Additional Major in Computer Science must complete all requirements listed above. In addition, at most 5 of the 12 computer science requirements can be double counted toward all other declared majors and minors. The mathematics and technical communication requirements can be double counted without restriction. Students, especially from interdisciplinary majors or with multiple majors or minors, are urged to consult with the Computer Science Program Director or the Undergraduate Program Coordinator in the CS Undergraduate Office to determine double-counting restrictions specific to their own situations."

Academics,"From its earliest days, Carnegie Institute of Technology (CIT) has considered undergraduate education to be the key element in the development of future leaders. In this regard, CIT has adopted a plan for education that is designed to equip students with the capacity to learn and to continue the process of self-education throughout their lives. The present curriculum incorporates this philosophy by providing the opportunity for both breadth in a number of engineering, science, humanities and fine arts areas as well as depth in a major area of concentration. To achieve these goals, our flexible curriculum has been designed to allow students to customize their program to suit their needs and to help each student acquire:"
Academics,"The curriculum encourages students to confront professional problems, accomplished through team and problem-oriented courses, as well as courses which emphasize design or individual projects. These classes stress creativity and independent thought and require the student to define the problem, propose a solution or a design in the presence of technical and socioeconomic constraints, to make judgments among alternative solutions, and to explore innovative alternatives to more conventional solutions."
Academics,"The Carnegie Mellon engineering education is based on engineering and science fundamentals that give students the skills to face new and challenging situations. The first year in engineering provides a broad foundation upon which students build a curriculum in their eventual major. Since students in CIT do not select a major until the end of the first year, all first year students share a common experience consisting of introductory courses in the engineering majors (one each semester), calculus, physics, other science courses which complements specific introductory engineering courses, and courses in the liberal arts, fine arts, business, and social sciences. This curriculum helps make an informed decision about a final major. Below is an examples of a standard schedule for a first-year engineering student."
Academics,"The College of Engineering has developed General Education Requirements designed to ensure that our students are ready to work effectively in the global economy, and become the innovators and leaders of tomorrow."
Academics,"The additional major is to be distinguished from a dual degree program, which results in two separate bachelor’s degrees; for example, Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering and a Bachelor of Arts in English. The dual degree, though, requires a minimum of 90 units of work in addition to the units required for the first degree. The second degree may be earned in Bachelor of Science or Bachelor of Arts degree programs."

Academics,"The Engineering and Arts (EA) additional major is intended for College of Engineering students who also have interest and talent in an arts concentration (architecture, art, drama or music) and goals that can only be accomplished at the intersection of those disciplines."
Academics,"The application includes an Essay of Interdisciplinary Intent, in which a student explains why they’re interested in the two areas and why they want to combine them. This essay should be brief—500 words or fewer—and specific about both a student’s background in the concentration areas and what their goals are for bringing them together."
Academics,"Each semester, Carnegie Institute of Technology recognizes students who have earned outstanding academic records by naming them on the dean’s honor list. The criterion for such recognition is a semester quality point average of at least 3.75 while completing at least 36 factorable units and earning no incomplete grades."
Academics,"When a student fails to meet minimum performance criteria, it normally results in an academic action. Depending on the circumstances, one of the following actions is taken: academic probation, continued probation, suspension, or drop. These academic actions are recommended by the college's departments, based on the guidelines described below, and adjudicated by the CIT Undergraduate Studies Office. However, the sequence of the academic actions is not automatic in all cases. Decisions may be based on unique individual student performance and circumstances, and are not determined solely on the basis of grades and quality point averages."

Students also pursue interests at the interface between the arts and sciences through the Bachelor of Science and Arts (B.S.A.) degree program combining biological sciences or neurobiology with a discipline in the College of Fine Arts. A stand-alone Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree is available for students who wish to expand their educational training into other fields. Many students choose to broaden their education by pursuing minors and additional majors in disciplines throughout the university, not just within the Mellon College of Science."
Academics,"One of the most important features of the Department of Biological Sciences is the opportunity for undergraduate students to interact with faculty. Providing a solid foundation to scientific practice is critical; therefore, the department offers first-year students a variety of inquiry-based, hands-on courses that incorporate a wide range of topics and interests within Biological Sciences. These courses kick-start the transformation of science students to scientists. We encourage our students to get to know their faculty through one of these courses, or through mentored, independent research projects in the faculty laboratories. Our faculty members are prominent research scientists who also teach beginning and advanced courses. The upper level teaching laboratories are located in the same building as the faculty research laboratories and share scientific equipment. We encourage students to make themselves aware of the research areas of the faculty and to develop research projects with faculty. While such research is usually most important in the senior year, it may begin earlier in a student's undergraduate training. The department has an Honors Program in Research Biology to facilitate a more intensive involvement in research for eligible students. During the past four years, more than 85 percent of the undergraduate biology majors have worked with faculty on their research and, in some cases, have been co-authors of research papers and have given presentations at national meetings."
Academics,"Since the fall of 2011, the Department of Biological Sciences has offered a B.S. degree in Biological Sciences at Carnegie Mellon University in Doha, Qatar. Students enrolled in either of these degree programs will also complete the requirements outlined below.

Academics,"Our group develops computational methods for understanding the dynamics, interactions and conservation of complex biological systems. As new high-throughput biological data sources become available, they hold the promise of revolutionizing molecular biology by providing a large-scale view of cellular activity. However, each type of data is noisy, contains many missing values and only measures a single aspect of cellular activity. Our computational focus is on methods for large scale data integration. We primarily rely on machine learning and statistical methods. Most of our work is carried out in close collaboration with experimentalists. Many of the computational tools we develop are available and widely used."
Academics,"Welcome to Psychology at CMU. With nearly 30 award-winning faculty and almost 150 people in total, we are a vibrant community whose research continues our department’s 100-year tradition of studying the deeper mechanisms and processes underlying human behavior and its social and neural bases. Innovation is in our DNA: our department has been at the center of helping create new scientific initiatives in artificial intelligence, cognitive science, neural-nets, the role of behavior and medicine and, more recently, university-wide efforts in
brain research
and the
science
of education
."
Academics,"We are mindful that research should have real-world impact. We have helped to create several successful companies, to build
science-based cognitive tutors
, to develop the emerging fields of
health neuroscience
, to better understand how
distraction in the classroom affects learning
, and to conduct longitudinal clinical trials focused on understanding the social and psychological mechanisms that predict and maintain physical and psychological well-being."
Academics,"The Psychology Department at Carnegie Mellon has long been noted as one of the pioneering Psychology Departments in the world, particularly in such areas as cognitive psychology, cognitive science, social psychology, developmental psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and health psychology. The Psychology Department offers B.A. and B.S. degrees in Psychology, as well as a B.S. degree in Cognitive Science, and together with the Department of Biological Sciences, a unified B.S. double major in Psychology and Biological Sciences."
Academics,Psychology is a science that embraces both biological and social sciences. It is a science concerned with establishing principles and laws regarding the ways in which people think and behave through the scientific study of human behavior.
Academics,The orientation of the Carnegie Mellon Psychology curriculum is toward developing highly skilled and knowledgeable graduates. A bit more than half of our graduates go on to graduate or professional school. The remainder seek to expand their problem-oriented skills so that job opportunities beyond those typically open to liberal arts students are available.
Academics,"Majors in the department are expected not only to learn about findings already established by psychologists, but also to become proficient in the investigation and analysis of behavior. This includes observing behavior, formulating hypotheses, designing experiments to test these hypotheses, running experiments, performing statistical analysis, and writing reports. The department has many resources for students to use in acquiring these skills. For instance, students interested in child development may be involved in the child development laboratory and observational facilities which are a part of the Carnegie Mellon Children's School. Students interested in environmental or health psychology might have opportunities to work in applied settings, and all Psychology majors have access to extensive computer facilities for data analysis and simulation work. The department also has a state of the art set of undergraduate research laboratories and computer clusters, and has recently acquired, through the Scientific Imaging & Brain Research Center a magnet for conducting brain imaging studies using fMRI."
Academics,"In addition to formal class work, students are encouraged to participate in research, project and field work via a number of opportunities available to them. They may register for Independent Reading in Psychology, Independent Research in Psychology, or an Internship in Clinical or Developmental Psychology. In the Independent Research course, the student may work on an ongoing research project or develop and carry out a new research project with a faculty member. There is university and departmental funding available to help support student-initiated research projects and student travel to present research results at scientific meetings and conferences. In the Readings courses, the student reads extensively on a particular topic. The faculty member and student meet to discuss the readings, and the student writes a paper on the topic selected. The Psychology Department Website (
www.psy.cmu.edu/
), Graduate Catalog and Undergraduate Research Brochure provide descriptions of faculty research interests that the student can use in determining who should be approached to supervise a particular research or reading project. Clinical internships are available with a variety of clinical settings including the prestigious Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic (the teaching hospital of the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh). During the internship, students get first-hand experience with different clinical populations. Developmental Internships are available in the department-run CMU Children's School. Finally, outstanding students are invited to participate in an Honors Program during their senior year. Over the course of their senior year, these students develop and carry out an original research project under faculty supervision."
Academics,"The curriculum includes three levels of psychological course work. These result in a breadth of knowledge of psychology, training in research methods and in-depth advanced course work in student chosen areas of psychology. Both the B.A. and the B.S. degrees are available in Psychology. Candidates for both degrees must also complete two semesters of calculus. There are three options in completing this requirement:
21-111
/
21-112
or
21-120
and either
21-122
or
21-256
. Students are also required to complete a statistics sequence consisting of
36-201
or it's equivalent, followed by
36-309
, Experimental Design. Both courses should be completed before the junior year. A one-semester computer programming course is also required for all Psychology majors. Finally, in addition to the H&SS General Education Natural Science requirement, B.A. candidates take one, and B.S. candidates take three additional semesters of natural science courses outside the department. This breadth of technical and scientific preparation has proven to be valuable both for students going on to graduate or professional schools and those entering the job market upon graduation."
Academics,"There are three suggested major tracks starting with the 200-level survey courses. These are cognitive or cognitive-neuroscience, developmental, and social-health-personality. The tracks are designed to provide increasing depth of knowledge in a particular area of psychology, although the student may as an alternative elect to combine advanced courses from more than one area into a meaningful program."
Academics,"Overall, the major includes Introduction to Psychology (or a 4th survey course),
36-309
, three survey courses at the 200-level, two research methods courses, two advanced courses and an experimental design course. These include a total of 81 units. Advanced courses, which are often in the form of seminars, examine in great depth portions of the three track areas. The 18-unit advanced course requirement must be fulfilled by taking content seminars or courses rather than through Independent Research, Independent Reading, or Internship courses. In addition to the small number of required psychology courses, the department offers a variety of other courses, seminars, independent research and supervised experiences. Students are encouraged to sample these by means of the large number of elective units that are part of the program."
Academics,"Prospective Psychology majors are encouraged to begin major requirements and prerequisites prior to the junior year, if possible. In particular, completion of the calculus and statistics sequences, Introduction to Psychology and/or one or more Psychology Survey courses would enable students to take corresponding research methods courses in the sophomore or early in the junior year, and thus prepare themselves to take advantage of research opportunities in the department."
Academics,"The Psychology major requires (for B.S. candidates) three additional natural science courses (with two in the same science) beyond the College's General Education natural science requirement. For the B.A. the requirement is one course beyond the General Education requirement in natural science. Given the growing relevance of biology to psychology, it is strongly recommended that for the B.S. a minimum of two courses in biology be included as part of the natural science requirement."
Academics,"In order to complete an additional major in Psychology, a student must fulfill all of the Psychology major requirements within the department -- in other words, the breadth requirement, computing requirement, three survey courses at the 200-level, two research methods courses, and two advanced courses.

Academics,"As a department, we focus on the science of psychology in three sub-domains: Cognitive Psychology, including Cognitive Neuroscience; Developmental Psychology; and Social/Personality/Health Psychology. Cutting across these areas are many common interests, including the biological basis of psychological processes, cognitive change and the role of instruction, computational modeling of psychological processes, individual differences and special populations, language learning, and psychosocial effects on health.
The faculty actively pursue research in these areas with rigorous methodology, a concern for underlying processes and biological foundations, and precise, often quantitative, description. They select specific topics with an eye for both theoretical importance and potential for eventual application. This approach has led the department to honors such as being placed first in scientific impact by a major national report. Our undergraduate program offers a major in Psychology awarding both the B.S. and the B.A. degree and a major in Cognitive Science that awards a B.S degree. There is also a unified Biology/ Psychology major. A minor in Psychology is available for students majoring in other departments. Of course, many students who do not pursue a major or minor in psychology enjoy our courses as well."
Academics,"Majors take two classes in research methods. Many students perform research by working in a faculty lab, taking an independent course for credit, doing a senior honors project, or volunteering to work with a graduate student. The department also actively participates in a nationally funded undergraduate research program that supports students working for a year in a faculty lab as a way of recruiting them for mental-health related research careers. To fund their research efforts, our students frequently receive university undergraduate research grants, and they are major contributors to the spring undergraduate presentation day (""Meeting of the Minds"") for grant recipients. In addition, our undergraduates have been very active in attending professional conferences and presenting research there. Our scientific orientation serves students with broad interests, including clinical psychology - for which a science education is outstanding preparation. We also offer some clinically oriented courses, and interested students have opportunities for internships in clinical settings."

The original Skibo Hall was razed in the summer of 1994 and replaced by a new student union that is fully Wi-Fi enabled. Known as the University Center, the building was dedicated in 1996.

The period starting with the construction of the Hall of the Arts building (former home of the Graduate School of Industrial Administration) in 1952 and ending with Wean Hall in 1971 saw the institutional change from Carnegie Institute of Technology to Carnegie Mellon University. New facilities were needed to respond to the university's growing national reputation in

, with its rejection of historical tradition and its emphases on functionalism and expression of structure, had been in vogue in urban settings since the 1930s, but mostly in Germany and other parts of Central Europe. It came late to the Carnegie campus because of the hiatus in building activity and a general reluctance among all institutions of higher education in the United States to abandon historical styles. By the 1960s, it was seen as a way to accomplish the needed expansion and at the same time give the campus a new image, as well as potential build quickly and cheaply, desirable goals with the swelling of American university student ranks in the aftermath of the passage of the

History,"In 1900, he donated $1 million for the creation of a technical institute for the city of Pittsburgh, envisioning a school where working-class men and women of Pittsburgh could learn practical skills, trades and crafts that would enhance their careers, lives and communities."
History,"With the end of World War II, the latter half of the 20th century brought unprecedented growth to Carnegie Tech. In 1956, the arrival of the first IBM computer to campus was revolutionary, initiating a university culture where information technology pervaded virtually all areas of study."
History,"In 1967, Carnegie Tech merged with the Mellon Institute, a science research center founded by the Mellon family of Pittsburgh, to become known as Carnegie Mellon University. The merger built upon a long history of support from the Mellons."
History,"The
Mellon Institute of Industrial Research
was founded in 1913 by banker and industrialist brothers
Andrew Mellon
(who went on to become
U.S. Treasury Secretary
) and
Richard B. Mellon
in honor of their father,
Thomas Mellon
, patriarch of the
Mellon family
. The Institute began as a research organization which performed work for government and industry on a contract and was initially established as a department within the
University of Pittsburgh
. In 1927, the Mellon Institute incorporated as an independent nonprofit. In 1937, the Mellon Institute's iconic building was completed, and it moved to its current location on Fifth Avenue.
[20]"
History,"In 1967, with support from
Paul Mellon
, Carnegie Tech merged with the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research to become Carnegie Mellon University. In 1973, Carnegie Mellon's coordinate
women's college
, the Margaret Morrison Carnegie College, merged its academic programs with the rest of the university.
The industrial research mission of the Mellon Institute survived the merger as the Carnegie Mellon Research Institute (CMRI) and continued doing work on contract to industry and government. In 2001, CMRI's programs were subsumed by other parts of the university or spun off into autonomous entities. [21]"
History,"During the 1970s and 1980s, the tenure of president
Richard Cyert
(1972–1990) witnessed a period of growth and development. The research budget grew from roughly $12 million annually in the early 1970s to more than $110 million in the late 1980s. The work of researchers in new fields like
robotics
and
software engineering
helped the university to build on its reputation. One example of this approach was the introduction of the university's ""
Andrew
"" computing network in the mid-1980s. This pioneering project, which linked all computers and workstations on campus, set the standard for educational computing and established Carnegie Mellon as a leader in the use of technology in education and research. On April 24, 1985,
cmu.edu
, Carnegie Mellon's Internet domain, became one of the
first six
.edu
domain names."
History,"On April 15, 1997,
Jared L. Cohon
, former dean of the
Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies
, was elected president by Carnegie Mellon's board of trustees. During Cohon's presidency, Carnegie Mellon continued its trajectory of innovation and growth. His strategic plan aimed to leverage the university's strengths to benefit society in the areas of
biotechnology
and
life sciences
, information and security technology,
environmental science
and practices, the
fine arts
and
humanities
, and business and
public policy
. In 2006, following negotiations between President Cohon and South Australian Premier
Mike Rann
, CMU opened a campus of the
Heinz College
in the historic
Torrens Building
in
Adelaide
, Australia. President Cohon's term ended on June 30, 2013, after which he returned to the faculty at Carnegie Mellon."
History,Carnegie Mellon was founded in November 1900 when industrialist Andrew Carnegie announced his intention to build a new technical school in the City of Pittsburgh.
History,"Andrew Carnegie's idea for this school centered on the need for practical problem solving, our hallmark in education and research to this day. Carnegie sought to create an institution modeled not on the great European or American universities rooted in the liberal arts, but rather on the Scottish model of technical schools designed for the needs of an industrial society. At such schools, children of working-class families could learn useful skills, trades, or crafts which, Carnegie maintained, were fundamental to improving communities, instilling self-discipline, and living a satisfying and productive life."
History,"The first students to attend the School of Applied Science and Technology were the sons of Pittsburgh's mill workers. They came to pursue a three-year diploma or a two-year certificate. Many did not have high school diplomas. No matter — Arthur Arton Hamerschlag, first director of the Schools, had no college degree."
History,"In 1900 the industrialist
Andrew Carnegie
gave a gift of $1 million to the city of Pittsburgh for the creation of a technical school. Originally called Carnegie Technical Schools, it was renamed Carnegie Institute of Technology in 1912. The institute merged with the Mellon Institute (established in 1913 in Pittsburgh by financier
Andrew W. Mellon
) in 1967. The university has built a reputation as a vital arts centre, operating three art galleries, two concert halls, and two theatres. The faculty has included Nobel Prize-winning economists
Herbert Alexander Simon
and
Merton Miller

Student Life,"The Panhellenic Council
(PHC) is the governing council for the six National Panhellenic sororities on campus.

The PHC, through its all-sorority programming efforts, promotes superior scholarship, leadership development and dissemination of information important to members in the Panhellenic community. The PHC is the coordinating body for recruitment and represents the single largest women's organization on campus."
Student Life,"Recruitment is a mutual selection process facilitated by the Panhellenic Council. Each student who registers for Panhellenic Sorority Recruitment is assigned a Recruitment Counselor (RC) to assist them through the recruitment process. The recruitment process consists of a variety of pre-recruitment events leading up to the primary weekend(s) for recruitment, which consists of three rounds. After each round, participants, referred to as Potential New Members or PNMs, must submit their preferences for which chapters they hope to see again during the following round. Chapters are asked to do the same with each PNM they met that day. Following the last round of recruitment, members are asked to submit their final preferences for bid matching, a process that determines which sorority each PNM will be invited to join."
Student Life,"The Greek tradition at
Carnegie Mellon University
began 111 years ago with the founding of the first fraternity on campus,
Theta Xi
, in 1912. As of the fall semester of 2016, the Greek community consists of 25 active fraternities and sororities: 6 Panhellenic sororities; 11 Interfraternity Council fraternities; 2 Asian American groups ""(1 fraternity and 1 sorority)""; 4 National Pan-Hellenic (historically African American) chapters represented on campus (2 fraternities and 2 sororities); 1 Music Fraternity for Women, and 1 Professional Business fraternity."
Student Life,"Popular organizations include athletic teams/clubs, fraternities/sororities and a huge assortment of clubs. Personally most of the clubs didn't do it for me, but many people get very involved. RAs freshman year will tell you to leave your doors open, but most people don't. Sporting events are pretty sparsely attended.
Dating...oh boy. There's a saying here that you develop ""CMU Goggles"" due to the unattractive population, and I have to admit that attractive girls are pretty few and far between. I hear it's the same for guys. Whether you want a relationship or hookup is up to you, and many people who were unlucky dating-wise before (such as myself) will have better odds here.
Traditions include the Fence, which groups will take over at night and paint as well as Carnival, which has Buggy races, building booths and about as much partying as the rest of the year combined.
As I said previously, socially CMU is lacking. Plenty of people here have no interest in a social life. There's really no parties during the week even at Pitt, but that's just sensible as you should be doing schoolwork then. Fridays are pretty light with some house parties every now and then, and usually 2 frat parties on a Saturday. Although it seems like the school is trying to get rid of Greek life (about 10 frats have been kicked off in the last decade), most of the groups are solid and the vast majority of partying goes on there. There's plenty of stuff to do non-drinking (go to a restaurant, museum, anything in Pittsburgh) but most of the social students drink moderately."
Student Life,"Seemingly fraternities and sororities are seen most often on campus selling things or whatnot. I am not really sure what other groups there are. I see students playing cricket sometimes or ultimate frisbee. There are a lot of student athletes as well. Also, students are fairly active in student government, i.e. it's a big deal here."
Student Life,"Carnegie Mellon offers a wide variety of activities and organizations for students. Trust me, when you walk into the Activities Fair at the beginning of each semester, you will know there is something for everyone. Academic groups and activities are very popular; these range from The Tartan (our newspaper) to organizations that support probably every engineering and mathematics program. Artistic groups are probably the most popular, and CMU offers a wide assortment of these fun and interactive clubs and groups. Scotch n' Soda (non-major theatre group), Dancer's Symposium, Lunar Gala (fashion show), and various vocal groups are all fantastic student activities, some of them even achieving national recognition. Last, but definitely not least, are social groups and sports groups. Around 20% of the student population participates in Greek life, and a large majority of the population participates in sports (for non-athletic people like myself, fun intramural sports are offered). Cross-country, rowing, tennis, and swimming are some of the most popular on campus. Outside of clubs and organizations, CMU hosts many fantastic events and guest speakers. Just this year, Mark Zuckerburg (CEO of Facebook) chose Carnegie Mellon as one of only three campus to speak to.
Outside of school, the social life is also at a great high. The city offers great venues for eating, music, film, and shopping for some fun on the weekend. And if you're looking for the 'classic college experience', there is almost always a party somewhere near campus that all are 'free' to attend (sometimes there is an entrance fee, especially for guys). No matter what your particular interests are, the school offers great opportunities to meet new people and develop great friendships."
Student Life,"There are 276 student organizations on this campus, and if it's possible that one doesn't match your interests you can pretty easily start a new one. Twice a year at the Activities Fair these organizations set up tables with plenty of information about themselves, and the members are eager to connect with you."
Student Life,"If you don't know what Carnival is, then you don't know Carnegie Mellon University. Every April, CMU students literally construct a carnival from the ground up for a four day holiday. Complete with carnival rides, student-made booths, Buggy races, frat socials, free music concerts, etc., Carnival is the weekend that CMU students live for. Carnival stretches from Thursday until Sunday with back-to-back-to-back activities. It is the time that students get to show their true colors and sport their neon hats and rainbow sunglasses while they chill in the sun with friends."
Student Life,"If there's just one word to describe the Carnegie Mellon student activity experience, it'd be involved. Despite a heavy course load, most students find time to get involved in at least one (although usually upwards of 4) student organizations. Greek life encompasses about 20% of our student body on any given year, and those folks are extremely active on campus. Other than that, Scotch n Soda Theatre, a student-run theater company for non-majors, is extremely popular with students that loved drama in high school but aren't majoring in it. There are several campus publications to work on, 5+ a cappella groups, international service organizations, intramural and club sports teams, and so much more. I've been involved in The Oakland Review, our oldest literary journal, as editor-in-chief and poetry editor; a committee member for the Hillel-Jewish University Center; a Highland Ambassador, a student link between Alumni Relations and our current students; and IMPAQT, an ambassadorship program to bridge the gap between our Qatar and Pittsburgh campuses. Every semester, countless speakers and musicians come to campus (often free events)--everyone from the New Pornographers to Chuck Klosterman to Mark Zuckerberg to the president of Rwanda to Guster. There is always something interesting going on, either on or off campus. Pittsburgh is awash with art gallery crawls, concerts, major league sports events, opera, orchestra, museums, and parks."
Student Life,"CMU has athletics but in all honesty there are about equal numbers of players on the field as there are fans.
There is one thing that CMU has that no other college can offer-BUGGY! It sounds a little crazy to the uninitiated but once you get involved you can have a great time. Buggy is part of Spring Carnival and involves teams gathered from fraternities, sororities, and independent organizations. Teams build a buggy, and participate in a race-sort of like a soapbox derby where you have to push it up the hill too. Teams practice and prepare all year for the race and those 4am build sessions are insane, exhausting, exhilarating, often silly and something that you'll remember forever(unless those paint fumes get to you)."
Student Life,"There are many organizations on campus to be involved with. We have sports teams, music groups, a student run theatre program, and many other groups. Since my major is music, I have not gotten involved with the organizations on campus in this sense. I did join Sigma Alpha Iota which is a music service fraternity. I am also in a social sorority as well. Fraternities and Sororities are not something that everyone is involved with on campus but it is something that I highly recommend. Every year CMU has Greek Sing, Carnival, and Buggy which are highly participated in by the greeks on campus. Greek Sing is where the sororities and fraternities put on 13 min musical performances. It is a huge charity event and competition. This year we made $12,000 for a local charity. Every April we have Carnival as well. This is a CMU tradition where the whole University shuts down for 4 days to let loose and have fun. Some events that happen during carnival are booth, buggy, food, and concerts. Booth is where organizations on campus spend time building mini fun houses. The Thursday of carnival the booths are open for the whole Pittsburgh community to check out. There are also rides and other activities for people to do. Buggy is a huge carnival event as well. Organizations on campus spend the whole year training for this race. It can be compared to a soap box derby and is a great competition to watch. The concerts are a great event as well during Carnival. This year The Roots performed and last year we enjoyed the band Spoon. Carnival is one of my favorite things about CMU and I look forward to it every year."
